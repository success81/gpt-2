\cb3 reactions we've seen from this\cb1 \
\cb3 twerk gate it needs to start mattering a\cb1 \
\cb3 whole lot more\cb1 \
\cb3 to a lot of people i'm glad that i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 starting to see more\cb1 \
\cb3 people out there supporting the owner\cb1 \

\cb3 and i wanted to even ask tonight do we\cb1 \
\cb3 want to do part two of that show\cb1 \
\cb3 or do we want to move on to the next\cb1 \
\cb3 show\cb1 \
\cb3 because i said what i had to say about\cb1 \
\cb3 it we took\cb1 \
\cb3 18 calls last night and i think i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty much done with the topic\cb1 \
\cb3 uh i want to go but if if you guys want\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 still talk about you know twerk gate\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know what else can be said i\cb1 \
\cb3 know some folks feel like they\cb1 \
\cb3 they want to you know say there's two\cb1 \
\cb3 cents about it but\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's pretty much done but\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to talk about it\cb1 \
\cb3 uh put a one in the chat room or two is\cb1 \
\cb3 the subject\cb1 \
\cb3 do modern women want to submit to men\cb1 \
\cb3 and when i say men i don't just mean men\cb1 \
\cb3 in general i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 those productive competitive successful\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean those high value men i mean the\cb1 \
\cb3 men that you ladies say you want\cb1 \
\cb3 do you modern women really want to\cb1 \
\cb3 submit to them\cb1 \
\cb3 because let's be real without a shadow\cb1 \
\cb3 of doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 i think we all understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 modern women want a high value lifestyle\cb1 \
\cb3 a lifestyle that 99 of you cannot afford\cb1 \
\cb3 to give yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 number one number two those same women\cb1 \
\cb3 still want to have\cb1 \
\cb3 children and not have to work\cb1 \
\cb3 to pay significant bills\cb1 \
\cb3 uh that is a lucky life in this country\cb1 \
\cb3 when 72 percent of mothers have to work\cb1 \
\cb3 full of part-time\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's always been asked well what do\cb1 \
\cb3 you what do you expect to have to give\cb1 \
\cb3 to get that kind of thing\cb1 \
\cb3 and so many women are just kind of like\cb1 \
\cb3 well what i bring to the table i bring\cb1 \
\cb3 me to the table nope\cb1 \
\cb3 we're gonna start defining the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation much better\cb1 \
\cb3 and the question really becomes look\cb1 \
\cb3 down look down in the description of the\cb1 \
\cb3 video\cb1 \
\cb3 let me open another window real quick\cb1 \
\cb3 the question becomes all right i get\cb1 \
\cb3 i get you want what you want i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 i get that you want what you want i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 but as we're in this whole reclamation\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 reclaiming relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 the gender war is over\cb1 \
\cb3 it's time to negotiate the peace\cb1 \
\cb3 and i've been asking this question for\cb1 \
\cb3 the last two to three weeks\cb1 \
\cb3 what needs to happen for you as a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 to happily submit to the authority\cb1 \
\cb3 of a man in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman to a black man what has to\cb1 \
\cb3 happen in order for you\cb1 \
\cb3 one person to submit to the authority\cb1 \
\cb3 happily submit to the authority of a\cb1 \
\cb3 black man\cb1 \
\cb3 and i also asked another question of the\cb1 \
\cb3 day\cb1 \
\cb3 because i want to build upon this\cb1 \
\cb3 thought\cb1 \
\cb3 why is it the young black women\cb1 \
\cb3 seemingly\cb1 \
\cb3 are so susceptible\cb1 \
\cb3 to this thing called feminism or\cb1 \
\cb3 womanism\cb1 \
\cb3 susceptible likely or liable to be\cb1 \
\cb3 influenced\cb1 \
\cb3 or harmed by a particular thing\cb1 \
\cb3 it amazes me how hold on\cb1 \
\cb3 it amazes me how many black women\cb1 \
\cb3 i speak with who\cb1 \
\cb3 before age of 25\cb1 \
\cb3 readily identified as a feminist or a\cb1 \
\cb3 former\cb1 \
\cb3 feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 i honestly thought that most women\cb1 \
\cb3 identified with feminism because\cb1 \
\cb3 of so many black women being feminists\cb1 \
\cb3 when i was a younger man i thought\cb1 \
\cb3 most women were like this\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought that's what it was and the\cb1 \
\cb3 question is why is it that so many young\cb1 \
\cb3 black women fall\cb1 \
\cb3 and we need to make the distinction\cb1 \
\cb3 between feminism\cb1 \
\cb3 which tends to have a negative\cb1 \
\cb3 connotation or this new thing\cb1 \
\cb3 womanist woman is uh\cb1 \
\cb3 take care of yourself girl do for\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself girl why is it\cb1 \
\cb3 that so many young black women fall\cb1 \
\cb3 susceptible to this\cb1 \
\cb3 between the ages of 18 16 and 23\cb1 \
\cb3 right as you're entering your prime\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 food for thought think about it but as\cb1 \
\cb3 we continue to move on understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 uh if the likes the engagement rate that\cb1 \
\cb3 means the likes dislikes\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever don't stay over 50 percent you\cb1 \
\cb3 know what's going to happen you're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to hear this song\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you don't want to hear that song\cb1 \
\cb3 you better get it up like right now we\cb1 \
\cb3 should already have 1250 likes\cb1 \
\cb3 tell me we should already be over 12.50\cb1 \
\cb3 we should be over 1250\cb1 \
\cb3 because we got 2500 people in here so\cb1 \
\cb3 when i look over here\cb1 \
\cb3 if i don't see the likes up i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 just click to the song\cb1 \
\cb3 boop and you'll hear it i don't wanna\cb1 \
\cb3 wear this tie clip\cb1 \
\cb3 it's restricting so\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get on to the topic modern women\cb1 \
\cb3 you phds i'm a phd i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 you doggy moms\cb1 \

\cb3 ashley and i'm gonna just let it play\cb1 \
\cb3 because in the conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm talking to a woman who hit a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 points that i want to discuss\cb1 \
\cb3 this week one let me say this to women\cb1 \
\cb3 in general black women in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley you are not victims\cb1 \
\cb3 black women you are not a special victim\cb1 \
\cb3 you got to give up this victim complex\cb1 \
\cb3 it gets you nowhere\cb1 \
\cb3 number one you're not a victim\cb1 \
\cb3 number two you damn sure not a special\cb1 \
\cb3 victim three the world does not owe you\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 number four it's competitive out here\cb1 \
\cb3 it's blood sport number five\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what are you prepared to do\cb1 \
\cb3 the the line from uh untouchables when\cb1 \
\cb3 sean connery\cb1 \
\cb3 gets shot and kevin costner is leaning\cb1 \
\cb3 over him as he's dying he's telling\cb1 \
\cb3 the bookkeepers on the train headed to\cb1 \
\cb3 miami and his last\cb1 \
\cb3 br his last words is he's dying what are\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 prepared to do women what are you\cb1 \
\cb3 prepared to do to get what it is you say\cb1 \
\cb3 you want\cb1 \
\cb3 let's listen to what happened with me\cb1 \
\cb3 and ashley and i'm gonna give my\cb1 \
\cb3 commentary and then we'll get on with\cb1 \
\cb3 the rest of the show let's get it\cb1 \
\cb3 the story what do you got for me ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i watched you a couple of times\cb1 \
\cb3 i had to hurry up working out to call\cb1 \
\cb3 okay because i wanted to disagree with\cb1 \
\cb3 you but on this topic i don't at all\cb1 \
\cb3 you wanted to disagree she's like i just\cb1 \
\cb3 i was waiting to call in to argue with\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 no on many other topics i do disagree\cb1 \
\cb3 with you but on this one\cb1 \
\cb3 um i completely agree and if i was at\cb1 \
\cb3 that restaurant i would be a woman that\cb1 \
\cb3 would stand up and say something because\cb1 \
\cb3 it hurts every part of my body to see\cb1 \
\cb3 black women can you imagine you you i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 sitting over there eating a steak and\cb1 \
\cb3 you eating some chicken the next thing\cb1 \
\cb3 you know somebody's twerking next to us\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean for real no i couldn't imagine\cb1 \
\cb3 and i don't think i put myself in a\cb1 \
\cb3 position to be in restaurants like that\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to cordell nelson\cb1 \
\cb3 love your work continue to preach and\cb1 \
\cb3 teach thank you fam\cb1 \
\cb3 but if i did see that if it did occur i\cb1 \
\cb3 would definitely i would say something\cb1 \
\cb3 what's crazy is though it's it was\cb1 \
\cb3 downtown dallas so\cb1 \
\cb3 it really shouldn't be like that because\cb1 \
\cb3 downtown dallas is expensive but since\cb1 \
\cb3 you got me\cb1 \
\cb3 what are some things you disagree with\cb1 \
\cb3 me on\cb1 \
\cb3 well staying on what you were talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about today i will disagree with you on\cb1 \
\cb3 this approach\cb1 \
\cb3 and as a black woman um\cb1 \
\cb3 how you approached that woman at the\cb1 \
\cb3 mall there were so many ways you could\cb1 \
\cb3 do it\cb1 \
\cb3 for a black man to come up to a black\cb1 \
\cb3 woman like you're too beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 for me to see you dead people are dying\cb1 \
\cb3 put that mask up girl i'm gonna see you\cb1 \
\cb3 alive\cb1 \
\cb3 there's just so many ways you could have\cb1 \
\cb3 said it to say that girl probably wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 called beautiful that whole day\cb1 \
\cb3 but it was something that you said i\cb1 \
\cb3 care about you i see you\cb1 \
\cb3 i want you alive look how you looking\cb1 \
\cb3 out here you look ridiculous but i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna say it with love\cb1 \
\cb3 i think that is the most important did\cb1 \
\cb3 you hear did you hear that\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i didn't approach you in a rude way\cb1 \
\cb3 no no i didn't say you don't listen\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but one one of the young ladies was\cb1 \
\cb3 like late teens yeah would have been\cb1 \
\cb3 inappropriate for me to get all\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of like that and see here's the\cb1 \
\cb3 thing even if i say what you're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i should not have to go\cb1 \
\cb3 that far when i can just approach her as\cb1 \
\cb3 a grown black man and a being\cb1 \
\cb3 professional i should not have to let me\cb1 \
\cb3 now i want you to notice\cb1 \
\cb3 how many times in this conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm being asked\cb1 \
\cb3 to give beyond the benefit of the doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 to a black woman because\cb1 \
\cb3 of her struggles her position\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the same thing that happened in\cb1 \
\cb3 the restaurant\cb1 \
\cb3 that man was everything well he played\cb1 \
\cb3 the music\cb1 \
\cb3 it's our culture it's this that off rip\cb1 \
\cb3 you're expecting black men to\cb1 \
\cb3 cower towel to you\cb1 \
\cb3 if this is how you think you are\cb1 \
\cb3 not fit to submit to a man\cb1 \
\cb3 who can submit to a man who has to cower\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 think about this think about what would\cb1 \
\cb3 happen\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that would have to go around\cb1 \
\cb3 submitting to black women he's not with\cb1 \
\cb3 cow tying to women he's not with and\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd have to submit to him\cb1 \
\cb3 makes no sense\cb1 \
\cb3 explain i should not have to kiss her\cb1 \
\cb3 but to get her to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what she knew to be right correct i i\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't rude i was like\cb1 \
\cb3 hey uh maybe you don't know people\cb1 \
\cb3 because she was making people\cb1 \
\cb3 uncomfortable\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i'm pretty sure so my question to\cb1 \
\cb3 you ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 is why is it that you ladies like\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself think\cb1 \
\cb3 a brother like myself should have to go\cb1 \
\cb3 over and beyond\cb1 \
\cb3 when she's not even willing to live up\cb1 \
\cb3 to the minimum standard\cb1 \
\cb3 set\cb1 \
\cb3 i shouldn't have to do this every night\cb1 \
\cb3 every night i have to\cb1 \
\cb3 ask you folks to hit the like button\cb1 \
\cb3 which is free\cb1 \
\cb3 every night\cb1 \
\cb3 likes for free\cb1 \
\cb3 do\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so i shouldn't have to keep\cb1 \
\cb3 asking you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 but we have 3200 people in here watching\cb1 \
\cb3 and we have\cb1 \
\cb3 one two three four oh\cb1 \
\cb3 let's see 3200\cb1 \
\cb3 guys keep the likes up i'ma say this to\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies who believe like ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 uh i'm sorry i men black men should not\cb1 \
\cb3 have to kiss your butt to get you to act\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact we need more black men\cb1 \
\cb3 checking you\cb1 \
\cb3 what kevin kelly the rest owner of the\cb1 \
\cb3 restaurant did\cb1 \
\cb3 whether you like his word choice or not\cb1 \
\cb3 the sentiment was correct\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be you're the only group of\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 who feel as though your men who you want\cb1 \
\cb3 to lead\cb1 \
\cb3 who you say you want to lead can't tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 and that problem is because well let's\cb1 \
\cb3 get into the rest of this conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 you'll see i need to comply there are so\cb1 \
\cb3 many times i find myself in situations\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 black women where i feel is so much\cb1 \
\cb3 aggression is so much anger\cb1 \
\cb3 that it almost makes me want to\cb1 \
\cb3 retaliate that way\cb1 \
\cb3 and react with that kind of emotion but\cb1 \
\cb3 i have to understand her life isn't my\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 and and some degree i can understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that where she's coming from\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean if you just sit back and realize\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what the black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 has to endure what does the black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 have to endure\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm serious what does the modern\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman have to endure\cb1 \

\cb3 want any man to type in the chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 30 sec from 30 seconds from now ladies i\cb1 \
\cb3 really want you ladies to write\cb1 \
\cb3 in the chat room what the modern black\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 has to endure that is so\cb1 \
\cb3 back breaking\cb1 \
\cb3 that people are supposed to approach you\cb1 \
\cb3 and just\cb1 \
\cb3 ah ma\cb1 \
\cb3 let me let me let me show that burden\cb1 \
\cb3 for you what is it\cb1 \

\cb3 so uh all right i already see\cb1 \
\cb3 one person is gonna get timed out\cb1 \
\cb3 i've yet to see what you ladies are\cb1 \
\cb3 saying that you have to endure\cb1 \
\cb3 you ain't picked the bale of cotton you\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't sat on the back of nobody's bus\cb1 \
\cb3 you're the freest most independent most\cb1 \
\cb3 liberated\cb1 \
\cb3 group of women that ever walked the\cb1 \
\cb3 planet\cb1 \
\cb3 yet you have to endure what\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley if you're listening i want to\cb1 \
\cb3 hear what\cb1 \
\cb3 black women have to endure\cb1 \
\cb3 so much that her\cb1 \
\cb3 and us are supposed to walk around with\cb1 \
\cb3 a heightened sense of awareness\cb1 \
\cb3 to lighten her load again she asked me\cb1 \
\cb3 to walk up to this woman and say\cb1 \
\cb3 hey ma you look beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 put your mask on would you i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 see you live\cb1 \
\cb3 what the french toast\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think that she understood how\cb1 \
\cb3 insane that sounded\cb1 \
\cb3 and you always talk about stats let's\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about stats\cb1 \
\cb3 but let me for you before you do that\cb1 \
\cb3 before you do that yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 earlier this day earlier today i was\cb1 \
\cb3 listening to\cb1 \
\cb3 brie larson she played captain marvel\cb1 \
\cb3 are you familiar\cb1 \
\cb3 okay brie larson was as being was get to\cb1 \
\cb3 run across the coals\cb1 \
\cb3 by other other actors because people\cb1 \
\cb3 don't like her and i was listening to a\cb1 \
\cb3 channel called charisma on command\cb1 \
\cb3 and they were going over an interview\cb1 \
\cb3 brie larson had with a magazine\cb1 \
\cb3 called wired and the problems bree\cb1 \
\cb3 larson was having is because a simple\cb1 \
\cb3 question would be an\cb1 \
\cb3 ask and she would take it and assume it\cb1 \
\cb3 was negative and then respond\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i feel like a lot of black\cb1 \
\cb3 women like yourself come from\cb1 \
\cb3 taking a new that point\cb1 \
\cb3 needs to be listened to this is why i\cb1 \
\cb3 always talk about good\cb1 \
\cb3 faith if you\cb1 \
\cb3 are finding yourself always upset and on\cb1 \
\cb3 the defensive\cb1 \
\cb3 you can read a lot into an innocent\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 go back and look at that interview with\cb1 \
\cb3 brie larson and see what i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 does brie larson work out that was a\cb1 \
\cb3 question that was asked\cb1 \
\cb3 what is that an insult what are you\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to say i look fat\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what this woman said\cb1 \
\cb3 why would you go there\cb1 \
\cb3 true thing and automatically assuming\cb1 \
\cb3 bad intent\cb1 \
\cb3 of course of course but but see that's\cb1 \
\cb3 not but but that's not of course and in\cb1 \
\cb3 her mind\cb1 \
\cb3 yes a bad intent of course we're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to assume a bad intent\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry ashley black women who think\cb1 \
\cb3 like her\cb1 \
\cb3 why i don't see\cb1 \
\cb3 what it is that you have to endure and\cb1 \
\cb3 your oppression\cb1 \
\cb3 your subjugation and then i know who\cb1 \
\cb3 this woman is you didn't see her on the\cb1 \
\cb3 camera\cb1 \
\cb3 but i did you know tall thin\cb1 \
\cb3 uh attractive dancer i'm like what\cb1 \
\cb3 what's\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't get it you're not a victim uh\cb1 \
\cb3 guys we're also gonna need uh one two\cb1 \
\cb3 three uh\cb1 \
\cb3 right now we're gonna need at least ten\cb1 \
\cb3 more people to throw something there\cb1 \
\cb3 because we're gonna get into this of\cb1 \
\cb3 course\cb1 \
\cb3 that is a mental defect in my opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 hit the dollar hit the super chat\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get it bad intent upon everyone\cb1 \
\cb3 and not include yourself no\cb1 \
\cb3 but when i talk i'm talking about a\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 look i don't have that type of anger i\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't raised with that i never saw that\cb1 \
\cb3 so i it's not in me to be like that but\cb1 \
\cb3 it is in me to be sympathetic that every\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman didn't have the\cb1 \
\cb3 opportunities that i had\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't have a two-family home didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 come in a higher middle class\cb1 \
\cb3 area was stripped down to\cb1 \
\cb3 feeling that my life is only what i see\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 impoverished that's my let me say this\cb1 \
\cb3 also\cb1 \
\cb3 many of you modern successful black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 have what i think what is called\cb1 \
\cb3 survivor's guilt\cb1 \
\cb3 knock it off trying to take on\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're a modern middle-class\cb1 \
\cb3 successful black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 stop trying to take on the burdens of\cb1 \
\cb3 the people\cb1 \
\cb3 who you don't know you sound crazy and\cb1 \
\cb3 disingenuous\cb1 \
\cb3 survivor's guilt well i have two parent\cb1 \
\cb3 household and i went here and such and\cb1 \
\cb3 so forth\cb1 \
\cb3 so i've had it easier than her\cb1 \
\cb3 uh then keep moving\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't go over there try to what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you want to do you think\cb1 \
\cb3 your parents your family put you in the\cb1 \
\cb3 position so you supposed to go back\cb1 \
\cb3 to go through mud and traps and holes\cb1 \
\cb3 that you were afforded to not have to go\cb1 \
\cb3 through\cb1 \
\cb3 there is no ver there is no nobility in\cb1 \
\cb3 poverty and we have this whole\cb1 \
\cb3 jesus christ struggle olympics to where\cb1 \
\cb3 we we try to make life\cb1 \
\cb3 so hard and you know one of the reasons\cb1 \
\cb3 i see a lot of you women doing this is\cb1 \
\cb3 because you don't have a man\cb1 \
\cb3 you're busy bodies with no time so you\cb1 \
\cb3 find [ __ ] to occupy your time\cb1 \
\cb3 and anything will do which is why you\cb1 \
\cb3 see so many of these women twerking in\cb1 \
\cb3 restaurants\cb1 \
\cb3 you're attention seeking because you\cb1 \
\cb3 have nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm tying it all together i always do\cb1 \
\cb3 three out of four of you are unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 and busy bodies\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning you are not getting attention\cb1 \
\cb3 from your man husband like most women\cb1 \
\cb3 would be at your age\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not working a job that's sustainable\cb1 \
\cb3 well now i understand but understand\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 we're in the most affluent mall in\cb1 \
\cb3 atlanta\cb1 \
\cb3 in the most affluent store we weren't in\cb1 \
\cb3 the\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not in the hood you're not in this\cb1 \
\cb3 hood but now what but what am i saying\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen listen listen yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 when white people\cb1 \
\cb3 came over to address them they got a\cb1 \
\cb3 completely different energy than when a\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 who's anybody who's ever met me will\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you he's what you see on camera\cb1 \
\cb3 he's a nice guy\cb1 \
\cb3 i was shocked at how nice he was in a\cb1 \
\cb3 suit\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't roll up on people calling them\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] and hoes and checking\cb1 \
\cb3 but i will give back to you what you\cb1 \
\cb3 give back to me if you give me something\cb1 \
\cb3 that i did not deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 but the way that these two young sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 responded to a man old enough to be\cb1 \
\cb3 their father\cb1 \
\cb3 then you had a white woman and a white\cb1 \
\cb3 man come over and get\cb1 \
\cb3 the master treatment and there you go\cb1 \
\cb3 you just said it you just said your\cb1 \
\cb3 answer right there\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's not their answer it's not no\cb1 \
\cb3 but the answer to your question is\cb1 \
\cb3 why is a white person getting this\cb1 \
\cb3 treatment and a black man in a suit is\cb1 \
\cb3 getting this\cb1 \
\cb3 treatment but that's why i said it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 mental defect and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly but but the accountability is on\cb1 \
\cb3 who\cb1 \
\cb3 see what you see we're on the same page\cb1 \
\cb3 except for when you told me\cb1 \
\cb3 the way i approached her that means i st\cb1 \
\cb3 that's where i can never go with you\cb1 \
\cb3 that still is me having to go\cb1 \
\cb3 extra over when somebody knows they have\cb1 \
\cb3 issues that's true and i can understand\cb1 \
\cb3 your point on that and who wants to do a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit extra\cb1 \
\cb3 but there is no negative to doing a\cb1 \
\cb3 little extra there is no\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to what this black woman just\cb1 \
\cb3 told me i understand where you're coming\cb1 \
\cb3 from\cb1 \
\cb3 no one wants to do a little extra but\cb1 \
\cb3 there's no negative in doing a little\cb1 \
\cb3 extra\cb1 \
\cb3 black men how how much extra do you feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like you get from the\cb1 \
\cb3 average blank black men how much extra\cb1 \
\cb3 do you feel like you get from the\cb1 \
\cb3 average ranking file system\cb1 \
\cb3 if you feel like you get extra from the\cb1 \
\cb3 average rank and file\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman type 100\cb1 \
\cb3 in the chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 because according to ashley there's no\cb1 \
\cb3 harm\cb1 \
\cb3 in doing a little extra so that means\cb1 \
\cb3 sisters shouldn't really have a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 doing a little extra especially for they\cb1 \
\cb3 black men\cb1 \
\cb3 but you know what's funny nicole\cb1 \
\cb3 michelle of the interbeauty movement\cb1 \
\cb3 caught a lot of heat and flack two years\cb1 \
\cb3 ago when she just simply asked black\cb1 \
\cb3 women to simply smile at every black man\cb1 \
\cb3 they saw\cb1 \
\cb3 her one day she got roasted for months\cb1 \
\cb3 just asking black women to just smile\cb1 \
\cb3 but this woman is telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 that i should the brothers should just\cb1 \
\cb3 be more empathetic and sympathetic\cb1 \
\cb3 and try to understand the struggles that\cb1 \
\cb3 they're going through\cb1 \
\cb3 and do extra all right\cb1 \
\cb3 then what are we getting them back what\cb1 \
\cb3 are we getting the return\cb1 \
\cb3 of changing your speech for that well\cb1 \
\cb3 for you to get\cb1 \
\cb3 where do you live where do you live i\cb1 \
\cb3 live in downtown l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh i live in atlanta and i was just\cb1 \
\cb3 in l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 i walk around like this every day\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't do you see this every day in l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 in a suit no yeah no let me go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 show you do you see this every day\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't see this every day now no so\cb1 \
\cb3 this is already\cb1 \
\cb3 good enough to get all the benefit of\cb1 \
\cb3 the mother sucking doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right you look great and you look\cb1 \
\cb3 so and if i approach\cb1 \
\cb3 and if i approach you in a civil way\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah already dressed above and beyond\cb1 \
\cb3 i should not get anything other than the\cb1 \
\cb3 minimum you would give to a white person\cb1 \
\cb3 but don't you think with the mentality\cb1 \
\cb3 of a young woman like you said\cb1 \
\cb3 you may look as dapper as you do but\cb1 \
\cb3 you're still a n-word in a suit\cb1 \
\cb3 just like facebook again but again i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not talking to a 14\cb1 \
\cb3 year old these women were adults and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's their problem\cb1 \
\cb3 that is true and i agree that's why i\cb1 \
\cb3 said okay so ultimately\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you trying to get me to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking someone to have mental\cb1 \
\cb3 capabilities that they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 apt to have well\cb1 \
\cb3 this one i'm asking i'm asking someone\cb1 \
\cb3 see when they start using a bunch of big\cb1 \
\cb3 words\cb1 \
\cb3 this is when the deception starts this\cb1 \
\cb3 is when the [ __ ] starts\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking someone to have mental\cb1 \
\cb3 capabilities that they're not apt to\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 in other words what\cb1 \
\cb3 you asking them to be more than they are\cb1 \
\cb3 you asking to be grown-ups\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking to be mature adults\cb1 \
\cb3 she couldn't say it that way yeah i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 asking i'm asking you to be\cb1 \
\cb3 a a damn adult\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm asking is the women who claim\cb1 \
\cb3 to be the strongest\cb1 \
\cb3 most educated don't need no man\cb1 \
\cb3 to be the equals they say they are and\cb1 \
\cb3 be the adults they claim to be\cb1 \
\cb3 and she has to be in that position and\cb1 \
\cb3 in that realm and in that box at a young\cb1 \
\cb3 at a young 20 you said early 20s late\cb1 \
\cb3 teens but but\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's at this listen to all the\cb1 \
\cb3 excuses\cb1 \
\cb3 all the excuses all the all the special\cb1 \
\cb3 conditions\cb1 \
\cb3 all the benefit of the doubt we're\cb1 \
\cb3 expected to give\cb1 \
\cb3 but is it coming back the other way and\cb1 \
\cb3 why is this important ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 well how\cb1 \
\cb3 do women who move through the world like\cb1 \
\cb3 this woman and the women i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 ever expect to get to a position to work\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperate with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 that's just cooperate cooperating\cb1 \
\cb3 submitting\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to continue to keep well anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 let's go age where many black women fall\cb1 \
\cb3 into this\cb1 \
\cb3 feminism womanism i don't need no man\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm good i'm independent scrubs and\cb1 \
\cb3 everything\cb1 \
\cb3 all right cool but then be that\cb1 \
\cb3 see what she should have done is\cb1 \
\cb3 come into neiman marcus that already\cb1 \
\cb3 requires you to have a mask on when you\cb1 \
\cb3 come in there\cb1 \
\cb3 they had to take their mask off you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't go into the store they have\cb1 \
\cb3 security at the door\cb1 \
\cb3 security says here's a mask here's hand\cb1 \
\cb3 sanitizer\cb1 \
\cb3 when you go through the door they make\cb1 \
\cb3 you pull them up young black men\cb1 \
\cb3 all pull them up even the ones who don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's the black women who walk around\cb1 \
\cb3 saying [ __ ] your couch\cb1 \
\cb3 why is it that young black women of\cb1 \
\cb3 black women are being more aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 towards authority than even men\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll tell you why ashley because they\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't getting the ass what\cb1 \
\cb3 they ain't out here getting shot um\cb1 \
\cb3 i i think being a black man and i never\cb1 \
\cb3 had a man in my household or i never had\cb1 \
\cb3 a male teacher\cb1 \
\cb3 all the people that had authority over\cb1 \
\cb3 me was my black mother\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying me i'm saying black women\cb1 \
\cb3 but my black mother when i went to\cb1 \
\cb3 school it was white men\cb1 \
\cb3 it was white women when i went to the\cb1 \
\cb3 hospital to took care of me it was white\cb1 \
\cb3 doctors\cb1 \
\cb3 and when i called for help it was a\cb1 \
\cb3 white man\cb1 \
\cb3 a police officer so when a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 comes up to me and when i say me i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 continuing to say a black woman in this\cb1 \
\cb3 mentality\cb1 \
\cb3 she doesn't see you as authority she\cb1 \
\cb3 sees you as someone provoking her she\cb1 \
\cb3 sees you as the daddy that left she says\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is the thing i\cb1 \
\cb3 you heard all that crap\cb1 \
\cb3 well then fine let's take let's take it\cb1 \
\cb3 that's true\cb1 \
\cb3 then this is what women like here's what\cb1 \
\cb3 women like\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley if that's the case then women\cb1 \
\cb3 like the ones you're referring to\cb1 \
\cb3 that's all they get in life by dog\cb1 \
\cb3 because if every black man becomes the\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't understand the logical jump from\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't see any men growing up\cb1 \
\cb3 to i see a black man in a suit and he's\cb1 \
\cb3 provoking me\cb1 \
\cb3 i want you guys to listen to that again\cb1 \
\cb3 and accept that and this mentality\cb1 \
\cb3 mother i'm not saying me i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 black women but my black mother\cb1 \
\cb3 when i went to school it was white men\cb1 \
\cb3 it was white women when i went to the\cb1 \
\cb3 hospital\cb1 \
\cb3 to took care of me it was white doctors\cb1 \
\cb3 and\cb1 \
\cb3 when i called for help it was a white\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 a police officer so when a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 comes up to me and when i say me i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 continuing to say a black woman in this\cb1 \
\cb3 mentality\cb1 \
\cb3 she doesn't see you as authority she\cb1 \
\cb3 sees you as someone provoking her she\cb1 \
\cb3 sees you as\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 if you never saw a black man why would a\cb1 \
\cb3 black man\cb1 \
\cb3 coming up to you speaking to you the way\cb1 \
\cb3 anyone else is speaking to you in a\cb1 \
\cb3 polite way be provoking you\cb1 \
\cb3 did you guys get that you're trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 paint a picture where i didn't see black\cb1 \
\cb3 male authority my entire life\cb1 \
\cb3 so when i see a black man that looks\cb1 \
\cb3 like authority instead of\cb1 \
\cb3 recognizing what authority looks like\cb1 \
\cb3 and saying oh\cb1 \
\cb3 hispanic male asian male middle eastern\cb1 \
\cb3 male white male\cb1 \
\cb3 managers police officer firefighter\cb1 \
\cb3 president all authority black men\cb1 \
\cb3 just like them authority too no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 you see a black man and your first\cb1 \
\cb3 response is to go all the way to the\cb1 \
\cb3 negative\cb1 \
\cb3 that made sense to her\cb1 \
\cb3 no no\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that mental defect i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about always presuming\cb1 \
\cb3 negative when it comes to a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 even when there's no evidence\cb1 \
\cb3 to the when there's uh no evidence to\cb1 \
\cb3 prove that\cb1 \
\cb3 and that left she said someone i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have to respect and this is the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i can accept that so\cb1 \
\cb3 listen but i can accept it but i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have to\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't i'm the world i don't owe her\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 she she knows that she knows that she\cb1 \
\cb3 has an\cb1 \
\cb3 abnormal reaction to me and it's on\cb1 \
\cb3 her how about this no different than if\cb1 \
\cb3 i had\cb1 \
\cb3 mommy issues and i looked at every black\cb1 \
\cb3 woman as the mother that hurt me\cb1 \
\cb3 i could not walk around treating women\cb1 \
\cb3 as the mother that hurt me\cb1 \
\cb3 and get understanding from black women\cb1 \
\cb3 even if it was justified you would still\cb1 \
\cb3 expect me to do something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 no matter what age i was\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't agree i wouldn't expect you i\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm trying to i'm trying to live my life\cb1 \
\cb3 with the understanding that everyone is\cb1 \
\cb3 not at the place that you are at\cb1 \
\cb3 okay did you hear that [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 you wouldn't expect an adult to act like\cb1 \
\cb3 adult\cb1 \
\cb3 you're just going to walk up to an adult\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm trying to live my life with the\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding that each and every human\cb1 \
\cb3 being that i encounter\cb1 \
\cb3 is not had my experience\cb1 \
\cb3 then you would never get anything done\cb1 \
\cb3 see\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley and women who think like this\cb1 \
\cb3 stop trying to plant black women as\cb1 \
\cb3 special victims\cb1 \
\cb3 and treat them like women who have a\cb1 \
\cb3 brain\cb1 \
\cb3 who know the difference between right\cb1 \
\cb3 and wrong and know what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 because when you treat them like\cb1 \
\cb3 spectacular special victims it absolves\cb1 \
\cb3 them from accountability\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like claiming um\cb1 \
\cb3 temporary insanity then they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not capable of of signing a\cb1 \
\cb3 contract\cb1 \
\cb3 it's when you claim some mental defect\cb1 \
\cb3 then they're not responsible\cb1 \
\cb3 see what we continue to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is paint them in this position to where\cb1 \
\cb3 uh well\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not responsible no you're\cb1 \
\cb3 responsible and let me say this other\cb1 \
\cb3 thing about\cb1 \
\cb3 i try to judge everybody individually\cb1 \
\cb3 the human brain\cb1 \
\cb3 human beings brains are set up\cb1 \
\cb3 to recognize patterns and take shortcuts\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot judge each and every\cb1 \
\cb3 in each and every human being you\cb1 \
\cb3 interact with on a daily basis\cb1 \
\cb3 that critically you would never get\cb1 \
\cb3 anything done\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to understand and make a\cb1 \
\cb3 judgment and this is why image is so\cb1 \
\cb3 important because it works\cb1 \
\cb3 in the subconscious it works under the\cb1 \
\cb3 surface\cb1 \
\cb3 it doesn't work in your front brain it\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't work right\cb1 \
\cb3 it's working in the background like the\cb1 \
\cb3 apps on your phone it works in the\cb1 \
\cb3 background\cb1 \
\cb3 and see this is this\cb1 \
\cb3 psychobabble that so much so many black\cb1 \
\cb3 people have heard that\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not responsible and given the\cb1 \
\cb3 benefit of doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 no you know right from wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know how to act and why is this\cb1 \
\cb3 important\cb1 \
\cb3 because if the gender war is over what\cb1 \
\cb3 are we going to do with these people\cb1 \
\cb3 that's where we're going what are we\cb1 \
\cb3 going to do\cb1 \
\cb3 with a group of women who she's going to\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you later on\cb1 \
\cb3 that these women are at the bottom what\cb1 \
\cb3 she's going to tell you that no one\cb1 \
\cb3 wants these women\cb1 \
\cb3 what are we going to do with a group of\cb1 \
\cb3 women who are at the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 that nobody wants that are completely\cb1 \
\cb3 unaccountable for their behavior\cb1 \
\cb3 and we don't hold them to any standard\cb1 \
\cb3 who they gonna pair with who they gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 work with where they gonna go\cb1 \
\cb3 there ain't enough um you wouldn't you\cb1 \
\cb3 wouldn't expect\cb1 \
\cb3 so you wouldn't expect a man to own his\cb1 \
\cb3 issues oh no\cb1 \
\cb3 i do expect a man to own his issues i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't expect a woman to own her issues\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly but i don't expect a man to own\cb1 \
\cb3 his issues that he does not see that\cb1 \
\cb3 they are there well\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think that you know how about\cb1 \
\cb3 this ashley how about this how about\cb1 \
\cb3 this ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 whether she whether she understands the\cb1 \
\cb3 issues whether she's\cb1 \
\cb3 got the level of understanding or or\cb1 \
\cb3 breakthrough\cb1 \
\cb3 what she does know is what she's doing\cb1 \
\cb3 is not working\cb1 \
\cb3 i i agree but if i know that what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 doing is not working and i don't have an\cb1 \
\cb3 outlet of something that does work\cb1 \
\cb3 and my friends are the same way if my\cb1 \
\cb3 mother's the same way if my honest the\cb1 \
\cb3 same way\cb1 \
\cb3 if i go to my neighborhood and it's the\cb1 \
\cb3 same way i don't have a clear\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding that\cb1 \
\cb3 why is she in nemesis anyway did you see\cb1 \
\cb3 her with shopping bags\cb1 \
\cb3 did you see how many she she just she\cb1 \
\cb3 just this is another thing\cb1 \
\cb3 verbal diarrhea and this is and i'm good\cb1 \
\cb3 at what i do because i can sift through\cb1 \
\cb3 this crap\cb1 \
\cb3 seven questions and then a redirect over\cb1 \
\cb3 to neiman's no i'm still on the trail\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not gonna throw me off on this\cb1 \
\cb3 it's still her responsibility\cb1 \
\cb3 to answer somebody in the chat room why\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't black men raising their daughters\cb1 \
\cb3 better\cb1 \
\cb3 uh ask the black mama eighty percent of\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 in the black community are in single\cb1 \
\cb3 mother-led households\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot blame the person who's not\cb1 \
\cb3 there for the product\cb1 \
\cb3 of you cannot blame the person that's\cb1 \
\cb3 not there\cb1 \
\cb3 for the outcome again\cb1 \
\cb3 you want you want better outcomes then\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of asking me this question\cb1 \
\cb3 truth whoever you are in the chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 since you think black men are\cb1 \
\cb3 should be raising their daughters better\cb1 \
\cb3 then what you do is you go on a campaign\cb1 \
\cb3 to get custody given to the fathers hell\cb1 \
\cb3 we might as well\cb1 \
\cb3 we know what two-parent households yield\cb1 \
\cb3 we had 80 marital rate prior to 1965.\cb1 \
\cb3 and black people did pretty dadgum okay\cb1 \
\cb3 was it post-1965 what do we have\cb1 \
\cb3 what do we have what do we have\cb1 \
\cb3 and then we got 80 single mother led\cb1 \
\cb3 household\cb1 \
\cb3 well let's try something different give\cb1 \
\cb3 custody to the fathers\cb1 \
\cb3 fathers fathers make fathers raise\cb1 \
\cb3 better children anyway because fathers\cb1 \
\cb3 go discipline instruction first not\cb1 \
\cb3 nurture\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on hold on hold on see what\cb1 \
\cb3 you just said is a bunch of\cb1 \
\cb3 if i don't have a clear understanding of\cb1 \
\cb3 my mama my auntie but\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact is she went over to niemans\cb1 \
\cb3 where stuff works see you can go and see\cb1 \
\cb3 what stuff works\cb1 \
\cb3 even if you go back to where stuff does\cb1 \
\cb3 it you have a choice of where you are\cb1 \
\cb3 see where you're not going to ever get\cb1 \
\cb3 me to go is taking\cb1 \
\cb3 100 accountability away from black women\cb1 \
\cb3 not a hundred percent i don't agree\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right this is where we\cb1 \
\cb3 no yo you're a moderators when somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 put something in the chat room you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 i need you to time them out don't remove\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 don't ban them i need you to time them\cb1 \
\cb3 out\cb1 \
\cb3 i ban people thank you but i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 you guys are getting too quick with the\cb1 \
\cb3 bands\cb1 \
\cb3 when you time them out i will see\cb1 \
\cb3 they've been timed out and then i will\cb1 \
\cb3 determine whether or not they should be\cb1 \
\cb3 banned\cb1 \
\cb3 person accountable but you said take it\cb1 \
\cb3 away 100\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right everyone's 100 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 accountable for where they're at exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 are you familiar with your high\cb1 \
\cb3 resolution i know\cb1 \
\cb3 the black back in the late 80s early 90s\cb1 \
\cb3 a black woman by the name of shaharazada\cb1 \
\cb3 lee wrote a controversial man\cb1 \
\cb3 asian men hispanic men the only person\cb1 \
\cb3 in this country who has never\cb1 \
\cb3 had her behavior analyzed\cb1 \
\cb3 the black woman and she caught\cb1 \
\cb3 so much hell because she was just asking\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 to sit back and understand that you were\cb1 \
\cb3 running your men away\cb1 \
\cb3 for your with your mouth your dish your\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 i challenge all ladies to go back and\cb1 \
\cb3 look at this period of time because\cb1 \
\cb3 while i'm hearing what you're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am i really am\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah the net net of it is black women\cb1 \
\cb3 are not winning\cb1 \
\cb3 they are not getting what they say they\cb1 \
\cb3 want and it is\cb1 \
\cb3 and human nature we are we are problem\cb1 \
\cb3 solvers\cb1 \
\cb3 we stop doing what doesn't work black\cb1 \
\cb3 women continue to dig\cb1 \
\cb3 what was she going to gain from talking\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] to me\cb1 \
\cb3 she assumed that i was not going to\cb1 \
\cb3 knock the furniture out of her mouth\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why she said what she said right\cb1 \
\cb3 see that's the problem black women are\cb1 \
\cb3 far removed from any consequences of\cb1 \
\cb3 their own actions\cb1 \
\cb3 to where they can stand up on a couch in\cb1 \
\cb3 a million dollar restaurant\cb1 \
\cb3 and feel like the owner was wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 it doesn't take psychoanaly\cb1 \
\cb3 psychoanalytics to know that there's\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to get a bad outcome when\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have consequences\cb1 \
\cb3 hey dumb and pink call in\cb1 \
\cb3 since you think my logic about single\cb1 \
\cb3 see\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't say my logic is trash logic\cb1 \
\cb3 is or is not true see\cb1 \
\cb3 i want you to understand there's a black\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who says logic\cb1 \
\cb3 is trash it's not kevin's logic\cb1 \
\cb3 it's logic logic is the same whether or\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 your trashy ass says it or i say it\cb1 \
\cb3 but only trashy people try to make\cb1 \
\cb3 something that's\cb1 \
\cb3 not subjective be subjective to their\cb1 \
\cb3 foolish feelings\cb1 \
\cb3 so you get your big ass on the phone\cb1 \
\cb3 when i open the call lines\cb1 \
\cb3 should she want to get down in the\cb1 \
\cb3 comment section and show your ass\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i agree i mean i'm gonna take a\cb1 \
\cb3 look at that uh book\cb1 \
\cb3 because i really you're in your future\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly your mentality on this because\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't i do want to hold and i do hold\cb1 \
\cb3 you know black women accountable for\cb1 \
\cb3 what they do i just feel like being the\cb1 \
\cb3 lowest and we\cb1 \
\cb3 you know black women are the lowest on\cb1 \
\cb3 the pole no one wants a black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 no one we disagree why do you think that\cb1 \
\cb3 he why do you think that he is\cb1 \
\cb3 why do i think that is i don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 does\cb1 \
\cb3 now now i want you to understand she\cb1 \
\cb3 came in thundering\cb1 \
\cb3 black women are the lowest or the lowest\cb1 \
\cb3 on the totem pole don't nobody want a\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 we're totally disregarded all this\cb1 \
\cb3 frontal assault and then asked one\cb1 \
\cb3 simple question\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but why\cb1 \
\cb3 see ashley and women who think like you\cb1 \
\cb3 you womanist you feminist you lean\cb1 \
\cb3 so heavily on the victim narrative\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm sorry that just will not work\cb1 \
\cb3 for building\cb1 \
\cb3 anything you cannot build\cb1 \
\cb3 couples families communities anything\cb1 \
\cb3 with one\cb1 \
\cb3 group perpetually being a victim\cb1 \
\cb3 saying a statement of fact you're at the\cb1 \
\cb3 bottom don't nobody want you\cb1 \
\cb3 right but see the way the victim\cb1 \
\cb3 narrative\cb1 \
\cb3 is it's nobody wants us and it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 fair they don't want us because they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know us they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't want us because they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 understand us they don't want us but the\cb1 \
\cb3 reason we're at the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 is not our fault\cb1 \
\cb3 the reason why 80 percent of children\cb1 \
\cb3 are born out of wedlock in a black\cb1 \
\cb3 community is not a black woman's fault\cb1 \
\cb3 not a woman's fault the reason 80\cb1 \
\cb3 percent or\cb1 \
\cb3 of our women are overweight is not our\cb1 \
\cb3 fault\cb1 \
\cb3 all right well okay then whose fault is\cb1 \
\cb3 whose responsibility is it\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's the government it's the high\cb1 \
\cb3 fructose corn syrup\cb1 \
\cb3 it's everyone else okay but\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you build anything\cb1 \
\cb3 with somebody that's always going to say\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i call that silly woman\cb1 \
\cb3 coming in talking about logic\cb1 \
\cb3 logic on this is trash i'm sorry if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a baby mama\cb1 \
\cb3 you choke no child gets born in 2020\cb1 \
\cb3 there was not wanted a mother chose to\cb1 \
\cb3 have that child\cb1 \
\cb3 33 forms of birth control prior to\cb1 \
\cb3 prior to uh conception\cb1 \
\cb3 multiple ways of dealing with the child\cb1 \
\cb3 post\cb1 \
\cb3 pregnancy heck women can even go drop\cb1 \
\cb3 you can\cb1 \
\cb3 you women can actually just give a kid\cb1 \
\cb3 up\cb1 \
\cb3 and no one says anything and see i look\cb1 \
\cb3 at women who come in here saying\cb1 \
\cb3 this is trash that's right what's trash\cb1 \
\cb3 is you're mad because you're in a\cb1 \
\cb3 situation that you chose to be in\cb1 \
\cb3 marry before you carry and you wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 have to worry about what somebody says\cb1 \
\cb3 about a single mother or baby mama or\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 see my mother had me out of wedlock but\cb1 \
\cb3 what she never tried to do\cb1 \
\cb3 was she never tried to act like it\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't her responsibility\cb1 \
\cb3 she never tried to run around playing\cb1 \
\cb3 the victim\cb1 \
\cb3 now why why do you what what reasons do\cb1 \
\cb3 you hear from\cb1 \
\cb3 black men as to why they don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 so the i think the majority that you\cb1 \
\cb3 hear\cb1 \
\cb3 their attitude and\cb1 \
\cb3 their unability to cooperate\cb1 \
\cb3 um and uh they're\cb1 \
\cb3 you know aggression mm-hmm so\cb1 \
\cb3 uh and also the weight so you point that\cb1 \
\cb3 out i agree with you on that as well\cb1 \
\cb3 so the attitude so the attitude yes if\cb1 \
\cb3 you've ever worked with a black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that when she goes to work she\cb1 \
\cb3 can get her attitude under control when\cb1 \
\cb3 her paycheck's on the line\cb1 \
\cb3 correct so it is something that she can\cb1 \
\cb3 choose to control\cb1 \
\cb3 correct um the inability to cooperate as\cb1 \
\cb3 an extension\cb1 \
\cb3 let me say something too if any woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that comes in my chat room talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 my brother my friend i know men who like\cb1 \
\cb3 women with meat on their bones i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 timing you out\cb1 \
\cb3 enough of that [ __ ] you guys put\cb1 \
\cb3 this meat on their bones to\cb1 \
\cb3 justify being overweight obese and\cb1 \
\cb3 morbidly obese\cb1 \
\cb3 not in this chat room you won't women\cb1 \
\cb3 should not weigh more than men and if\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't get around that\cb1 \
\cb3 go somewhere else but we had enough of\cb1 \
\cb3 this calling it\cb1 \
\cb3 thick and fat and curvy and voluptuous\cb1 \
\cb3 when a woman is five foot eight and 210\cb1 \
\cb3 pounds the size of an nfl running back\cb1 \
\cb3 don't tell me about meat on their bones\cb1 \
\cb3 moderators if you see a woman coming\cb1 \
\cb3 here talking that [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 time them out you cannot say what you\cb1 \
\cb3 want and\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a benevolent dictatorship this\cb1 \
\cb3 is not a democracy\cb1 \
\cb3 i am tired of hearing the same bull crap\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to talk that bullcrap go\cb1 \
\cb3 over to somebody else's channel\cb1 \
\cb3 who will collect and let it slide over\cb1 \
\cb3 here we deal\cb1 \
\cb3 with trying to make something work men\cb1 \
\cb3 do not\cb1 \
\cb3 want women that weigh more than you and\cb1 \
\cb3 if your brother likes\cb1 \
\cb3 women with a little meat on your bones\cb1 \
\cb3 you notice the one thing she did not say\cb1 \
\cb3 is she didn't say his wife had meat on\cb1 \
\cb3 her bones\cb1 \
\cb3 never attitude um\cb1 \
\cb3 they're you know masculine all that\cb1 \
\cb3 other kind of stuff and then wait\cb1 \
\cb3 wait is they you go back from 1980\cb1 \
\cb3 1990 on back you didn't see 300 pound\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 we everything that you have mentioned is\cb1 \
\cb3 100\cb1 \
\cb3 under under the control of said black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 and black men have been saying your\cb1 \
\cb3 it's your attitude your inability to\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperate\cb1 \
\cb3 and your size and what have we gotten\cb1 \
\cb3 they've gotten more of the same we got\cb1 \
\cb3 to the point where women like lizzo\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i hate when you keep mentioning her\cb1 \
\cb3 but i use her because she's an avatar\cb1 \
\cb3 we got a woman the size of lizzo who\cb1 \
\cb3 says she wants to deal she doesn't want\cb1 \
\cb3 to deal with any guys her size she wants\cb1 \
\cb3 a guy\cb1 \
\cb3 to be fit with a six-pack right and not\cb1 \
\cb3 right and unfortunately that's an\cb1 \
\cb3 example that out of all the black\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful black women black singers and\cb1 \
\cb3 uh black actresses that\cb1 \
\cb3 can be a staple and push to the front\cb1 \
\cb3 they're gonna push a narrative\cb1 \
\cb3 they were all big loud who's they ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 again who's they\cb1 \
\cb3 they're going to push a narrative black\cb1 \
\cb3 women control black\cb1 \
\cb3 black women control media black women\cb1 \
\cb3 control their own image\cb1 \
\cb3 essence ebony mata noir\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you have pl there is black female\cb1 \
\cb3 media\cb1 \
\cb3 oprah winfrey's own network\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies push lizzo to the front\cb1 \
\cb3 don't act like it's the boogeyman white\cb1 \
\cb3 folks or the\cb1 \
\cb3 no no\cb1 \
\cb3 but then when i said well here's the\cb1 \
\cb3 next part obnoxious well then why can't\cb1 \
\cb3 hallelujah\cb1 \
\cb3 keep it black why can't why can't halle\cb1 \
\cb3 berry or lisa ray two beautiful black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 equally as single why can't they keep\cb1 \
\cb3 black men\cb1 \
\cb3 you tell me why can't they same thing\cb1 \
\cb3 halle berry was the most beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 person on the planet and i know david\cb1 \
\cb3 i know david justice her ex halle berry\cb1 \
\cb3 is a now what i want you to notice the\cb1 \
\cb3 lack of introspection every time i ask\cb1 \
\cb3 her a question about black women\cb1 \
\cb3 it's always i don't know you tell me but\cb1 \
\cb3 yet she's a\cb1 \
\cb3 but this feminist womanist\cb1 \
\cb3 you'll just defend you openly defend\cb1 \
\cb3 black women but when asked any questions\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 well why is it why is it that way\cb1 \
\cb3 why are black women at the bottom since\cb1 \
\cb3 you said here at the bottom why can't\cb1 \
\cb3 halle berry\cb1 \
\cb3 or um what's the other woman i said\cb1 \
\cb3 can't keep up can't keep can't keep a\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i never thought about it well i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't ask any questions what\cb1 \
\cb3 is going to make women look bad we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to put accountability on women\cb1 \
\cb3 because that destroys my narrative\cb1 \
\cb3 because that means to put accountability\cb1 \
\cb3 on them the next thing is going to come\cb1 \
\cb3 is cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 but as long as you can hang over here in\cb1 \
\cb3 the dysfunction you never have to worry\cb1 \
\cb3 about getting over here to the\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 see why this works is because this kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of [ __ ] is the gender war\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the chaos that keeps on going on\cb1 \
\cb3 the gender war and the gender war is\cb1 \
\cb3 over that's why i'm talking about this\cb1 \
\cb3 this kind of mindset is dead go away\cb1 \
\cb3 bye it's over the gender war is done\cb1 \
\cb3 came through and black people realized\cb1 \
\cb3 that you were at the bottom black men\cb1 \
\cb3 and black women and everybody else was\cb1 \
\cb3 sheltered in place with each other\cb1 \
\cb3 black men black women more alone you all\cb1 \
\cb3 realize now\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody this year 2020 has been a\cb1 \
\cb3 reset for what it means\cb1 \
\cb3 it's over black women black men people\cb1 \
\cb3 want relationships now the question is\cb1 \
\cb3 can you get one and this gender war\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff to where\cb1 \
\cb3 you can continue to be in the chaos and\cb1 \
\cb3 never have to ask they can keep you over\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 see while all this is going on you never\cb1 \
\cb3 have to move on down but see the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 is\cb1 \
\cb3 if this stops if the war is over and you\cb1 \
\cb3 actually got to say okay\cb1 \
\cb3 what who are left because after the war\cb1 \
\cb3 is over\cb1 \
\cb3 wars are fought by armies armies are\cb1 \
\cb3 put together by the people who go into\cb1 \
\cb3 the military\cb1 \
\cb3 who go into the offices and things like\cb1 \
\cb3 that who are career military\cb1 \
\cb3 but when you have a major army they\cb1 \
\cb3 draft people\cb1 \
\cb3 and that comes from the citizenry the\cb1 \
\cb3 population\cb1 \
\cb3 in world war ii people who went to fight\cb1 \
\cb3 in the war were not all in the army they\cb1 \
\cb3 were bakers and shoot\cb1 \
\cb3 taxi drivers and plumbers and\cb1 \
\cb3 electricians and\cb1 \
\cb3 carpenters you know saving private ryan\cb1 \
\cb3 a school\cb1 \
\cb3 teacher but they had to go fight in the\cb1 \
\cb3 war but when the war was over\cb1 \
\cb3 and this side had their casualties and\cb1 \
\cb3 that side had their casualties and it\cb1 \
\cb3 was all over\cb1 \
\cb3 the people who were left had to sit down\cb1 \
\cb3 at the table negotiate the peace and\cb1 \
\cb3 then go back to running\cb1 \
\cb3 a life in the country see there were\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 who wanted the war to continue because\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't live in peace\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't live in normal see when the\cb1 \
\cb3 when the gender war is over\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to see a lot of this kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of mindset still by themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 what are in the shade room shout out to\cb1 \
\cb3 them put the stat up that marriages are\cb1 \
\cb3 up divorces\cb1 \
\cb3 are down divorces that are 50 50 year\cb1 \
\cb3 low\cb1 \
\cb3 marriages at a 50-year high that's\cb1 \
\cb3 outside the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 black people black women do you know how\cb1 \
\cb3 to be in a relationship with a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 you know how to have sex with him you\cb1 \
\cb3 know how to argue with him\cb1 \
\cb3 but do you know how to cooperate with\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 and see that's why this chaos is so\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why you get so much with this to\cb1 \
\cb3 the fight but over here scares them\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 here's but over here you can have a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of women who have a reason for not\cb1 \
\cb3 having a man\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't have a man because the gender\cb1 \
\cb3 war i don't have a man because we're in\cb1 \
\cb3 war and i got to stay on a war footing\cb1 \
\cb3 what about peace time what's going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 the excuse\cb1 \
\cb3 for all the phds i'm a phd and ain't no\cb1 \
\cb3 more war no more bullets\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't need to make any more tanks and\cb1 \
\cb3 planes we're making steel for buildings\cb1 \
\cb3 and things like that\cb1 \
\cb3 then you start seeing these sustained\cb1 \
\cb3 women still walking around\cb1 \
\cb3 like well why why you still don't have a\cb1 \
\cb3 husband\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it always makes sense\cb1 \
\cb3 ride with your godfather\cb1 \
\cb3 black women's attitude towards black men\cb1 \
\cb3 you're at the you're at the you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying you're at the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 but what you do have is you have the man\cb1 \
\cb3 that other women want to get with black\cb1 \
\cb3 men are echo\cb1 \
\cb3 are nowhere close to being near white\cb1 \
\cb3 men as far as the financial\cb1 \
\cb3 black men are at the bottom too right\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 but sexual marketplace value number two\cb1 \
\cb3 right under white men correct why\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 in spite of the average black men's\cb1 \
\cb3 perceived educational value income this\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 he has a\cb1 \
\cb3 not even talking about the bedroom black\cb1 \
\cb3 men raised in the matriarchy\cb1 \
\cb3 more likely to listen to the the uh\cb1 \
\cb3 input of those women versus non-black\cb1 \
\cb3 men white men hispanic men\cb1 \
\cb3 asian men movies they don't really\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to their women so if you're at\cb1 \
\cb3 the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 and you got the man who was sought after\cb1 \
\cb3 by other women still trying to work with\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 why why are black women continuing to\cb1 \
\cb3 give black men louder\cb1 \
\cb3 bigger and even worse we're starting to\cb1 \
\cb3 get purple hair\cb1 \
\cb3 now i mean come on man\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll black and i'm i'll cut this really\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley all black men want\cb1 \
\cb3 is a woman to work with can you work\cb1 \
\cb3 with me\cb1 \
\cb3 can you co that's it\cb1 \
\cb3 in a nutshell all the rank and file\cb1 \
\cb3 black man wants\cb1 \
\cb3 is a woman to work with him can you\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperate with\cb1 \
\cb3 that's it why are you at the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 she said it inability to cooperate\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressive loud\cb1 \
\cb3 all the things go along with that and\cb1 \
\cb3 then i put in the weight part of it she\cb1 \
\cb3 agreed\cb1 \
\cb3 so if you're at the bottom you know\cb1 \
\cb3 you're at the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you continuing why are you\cb1 \
\cb3 getting louder\cb1 \
\cb3 bigger more difficult\cb1 \
\cb3 standing on furniture twerking and then\cb1 \
\cb3 getting\cb1 \
\cb3 big purple hair and long raptor nails\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going the wrong direction\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're comfortable in the war\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what happens the tip of the\cb1 \
\cb3 spear put the marines in or seal team\cb1 \
\cb3 six\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what i think of when i see a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of women who are just extreme like that\cb1 \
\cb3 they're extreme warriors because that's\cb1 \
\cb3 all like all you can exist in is war you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't exist in peace\cb1 \
\cb3 who you gonna see that in the\cb1 \
\cb3 neighborhood somewhere\cb1 \

\cb3 to increase the property value so we can\cb1 \

\cb3 no oh jesus well explain to okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um we got a great lawn guy i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 what they can do about the candy paint\cb1 \
\cb3 we're gonna have to just let\cb1 \
\cb3 let them let that we got to let the\cb1 \
\cb3 grass die\cb1 \
\cb3 off and then they'll probably be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 work with you but after that\cb1 \
\cb3 just keep it\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 just keep it cut and green it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 green is fine\cb1 \
\cb3 green but not the kid i'm sorry i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 even get through that\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'll ask you do you want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 married yes i do\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i asked this question the other day\cb1 \
\cb3 of all of many black women what is it\cb1 \
\cb3 going to take for you\cb1 \
\cb3 individually to happily submit to the\cb1 \
\cb3 authority of one\cb1 \
\cb3 man oh i come from a mother who submits\cb1 \
\cb3 i must\cb1 \
\cb3 easily as soon as that black you mean\cb1 \
\cb3 the characteristics\cb1 \
\cb3 now i gotta say this actually if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 listening i missed this part\cb1 \
\cb3 she's like i come from a mother said who\cb1 \
\cb3 submits baby girl\cb1 \
\cb3 i would love to hear your answer because\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're gonna tell me\cb1 \
\cb3 it's easy for you to submit oh\cb1 \
\cb3 ho ho ho ho\cb1 \
\cb3 all right well i'm just saying that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 question that black women need to answer\cb1 \
\cb3 for themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 that because it's uh so but yeah you\cb1 \
\cb3 should call back in\cb1 \
\cb3 it'll be spirited debate why don't you\cb1 \
\cb3 should have said hello while i was out\cb1 \
\cb3 in l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 uh was that last week oh really really\cb1 \
\cb3 really\cb1 \
\cb3 i was there i did i did a remote from la\cb1 \
\cb3 all last week so\cb1 \
\cb3 um yeah but yeah i'm gonna call in on\cb1 \
\cb3 another time where a topic that you know\cb1 \
\cb3 come on a different stance but i think\cb1 \
\cb3 we are in agreeance um\cb1 \
\cb3 all right then peace out thank you all\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 thank and i thank her for calling in\cb1 \
\cb3 because she was at least honest about\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think a lot of black women even\cb1 \
\cb3 realize that they're feminists\cb1 \
\cb3 remember i did a broadcast about three\cb1 \
\cb3 or four months ago christian feminists\cb1 \
\cb3 there were so many black women who did\cb1 \
\cb3 not realize they were both christians\cb1 \
\cb3 and feminists\cb1 \
\cb3 and i think it was because at the\cb1 \
\cb3 beginning i said black women for the\cb1 \
\cb3 most part\cb1 \
\cb3 get they get indoctrinated to feminism\cb1 \
\cb3 early on and don't realize how how\cb1 \
\cb3 damaging it is to their relational\cb1 \
\cb3 prospects\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care if you were raised in a\cb1 \
\cb3 two-parent household i don't think there\cb1 \
\cb3 was any man\cb1 \
\cb3 especially a traditional man or a man\cb1 \
\cb3 who's uh\cb1 \
\cb3 want to be a hundred percent who would\cb1 \
\cb3 think the woman i was talking to\cb1 \
\cb3 would be easy to deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 now that's where the disconnect is going\cb1 \
\cb3 to come down\cb1 \
\cb3 because all it takes is one the question\cb1 \
\cb3 i asked at the end\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it going to take for you\cb1 \
\cb3 individually\cb1 \
\cb3 to happily submit to the authority\cb1 \
\cb3 of a black man see this takes all the\cb1 \
\cb3 dusty\cb1 \
\cb3 and these dudes out here ain't doing\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing no no no i'm getting right down\cb1 \
\cb3 to the piece\cb1 \
\cb3 all right the war is over what's it\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna take for you to be happily submit\cb1 \
\cb3 to the authority of a black man because\cb1 \
\cb3 now it's gonna say well now i gotta look\cb1 \
\cb3 to see what's possible\cb1 \
\cb3 because 51 percent of black men are\cb1 \
\cb3 single and childless\cb1 \
\cb3 black demographics.com black statistics\cb1 \
\cb3 by black people for black people look it\cb1 \
\cb3 up\cb1 \
\cb3 64 percent are in the middle class so we\cb1 \
\cb3 can dispel with this whole thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 there ain't no men out there they're out\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it going to do for you to\cb1 \
\cb3 happily be able to get down\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperate see if you want to call\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want to submit then don't\cb1 \
\cb3 ask for a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to submit high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 are not in your they're not in your\cb1 \
\cb3 purview\cb1 \
\cb3 you can be a side chick to one you can\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with one\cb1 \
\cb3 but be a long companion or a wife nope\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 don't deal with modern women like that\cb1 \
\cb3 not something they're going to say\cb1 \
\cb3 openly because\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't want to run a fowler this\cb1 \
\cb3 cancel culture but i will tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll deal with you but no that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 they end up dealing with the lawyer\cb1 \
\cb3 and marrying the girl who works uh at\cb1 \
\cb3 the bank\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 where you fall ladies modern women\cb1 \
\cb3 do you want to submit to men if you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to submit to a man\cb1 \
\cb3 then that automatically takes you out of\cb1 \
\cb3 that 100 category\cb1 \
\cb3 having a provider who's paying a it puts\cb1 \
\cb3 you in a 50\cb1 \
\cb3 50 60 40\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe 65 35 situation\cb1 \
\cb3 but it didn't it doesn't even put you in\cb1 \
\cb3 a 70 30\cb1 \
\cb3 well maybe a 70 30 but it doesn't get\cb1 \
\cb3 you any better than the 75\cb1 \
\cb3 25. see if a man is still paying three\cb1 \
\cb3 times as much as you're paying\cb1 \
\cb3 he's going to want submission see the\cb1 \
\cb3 only man who will really accept\cb1 \
\cb3 not being the lack of submission\cb1 \
\cb3 or guys who need you financially\cb1 \
\cb3 those are only guys who would even think\cb1 \
\cb3 about doing it\cb1 \
\cb3 but the problem is for you ladies is\cb1 \
\cb3 guys who are that way\cb1 \
\cb3 would rather not deal with you let me\cb1 \
\cb3 say this black women i'm hoping to open\cb1 \
\cb3 up the uh call line\cb1 \
\cb3 the men who are the trait the skilled\cb1 \
\cb3 tradesman the the guys who are making\cb1 \
\cb3 65 the guys who are making 55\cb1 \
\cb3 55 to 75 000 a year the black man right\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 the guys who in generations gone past\cb1 \
\cb3 um would have probably been stepfathers\cb1 \
\cb3 uh some form of 50 50 or whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys have heard seen and they\cb1 \
\cb3 witnessed too much from their\cb1 \
\cb3 grandfathers\cb1 \
\cb3 their fathers and uncles everybody these\cb1 \
\cb3 guys are just deciding to sit it out and\cb1 \
\cb3 say\cb1 \
\cb3 i'd rather have nothing than to deal\cb1 \
\cb3 with a 50 50 situation because i know\cb1 \
\cb3 all the things that come along with\cb1 \
\cb3 having a woman who's not willing to\cb1 \
\cb3 happily submit with you i'm going to end\cb1 \
\cb3 up in a blue pill\cb1 \
\cb3 beta male situation guys are just saying\cb1 \
\cb3 they'd rather not do it\cb1 \
\cb3 or they're going to get a woman from\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 culture who will\cb1 \
\cb3 do like gabby city bay and say i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 married for love instead of money\cb1 \
\cb3 because apparently that's okay\cb1 \
\cb3 right that's what we said last week and\cb1 \
\cb3 see that's a lot of men in that 55 to 75\cb1 \
\cb3 range\cb1 \
\cb3 when you start getting into that 80 when\cb1 \
\cb3 you start getting into that 75\cb1 \
\cb3 to 85 range you start getting into that\cb1 \
\cb3 top 15 percent of blackmail earners\cb1 \
\cb3 oh they're gonna want what they see the\cb1 \
\cb3 the guys who are making six figures they\cb1 \
\cb3 won't they're going to want closer to\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 than the dude that's making uh 40 000.\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies you got to understand what your\cb1 \
\cb3 value is\cb1 \
\cb3 what your price is what you can actually\cb1 \
\cb3 get on the open market\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're a vehicle whatever you are\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the kelly blue book value of you\cb1 \
\cb3 on the market\cb1 \
\cb3 all right you need to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 and then decide who you're going to sell\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how you negotiate the piece\cb1 \
\cb3 it's about selling sitting down one to\cb1 \
\cb3 one i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so get them on out vietnam\cb1 \
\cb3 because this whole gender war this chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 back and forth yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 that works that keep that keeps a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 that keeps a lot of energy going on and\cb1 \
\cb3 what it does\cb1 \
\cb3 is it keeps a lot of it keeps a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 uh attention because you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 anything else\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why when you go to seminars it'll\cb1 \
\cb3 be 900 women and the only men there are\cb1 \
\cb3 the men on stage\cb1 \
\cb3 what does that tell you if you're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to a seminar and there are 900 women\cb1 \

\cb3 are on stage are presenting\cb1 \

\cb3 would think i think it's pretty doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 make sense\cb1 \
\cb3 well i guess that's and see that's and\cb1 \
\cb3 see what and see what you just said is\cb1 \
\cb3 going to give\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot give those fear-minded women in\cb1 \
\cb3 out see\cb1 \
\cb3 you can submit and still not work out\cb1 \
\cb3 that's okay but you know that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what people are going to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever reasons things didn't work out\cb1 \
\cb3 you know like i gave the one example the\cb1 \
\cb3 guy didn't care about his health\cb1 \
\cb3 you know for me health is very important\cb1 \
\cb3 well hold on hold on okay hold on\cb1 \
\cb3 no cynthia was basically just going over\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact that she said submission is\cb1 \
\cb3 easy\cb1 \
\cb3 and um i was just asking her you know\cb1 \
\cb3 you guys can hear what i was saying\cb1 \
\cb3 but anyway uh hold on uh cynthia amy\cb1 \
\cb3 hey how are you i'm doing well how are\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you have for me well you asked\cb1 \
\cb3 the question\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and so i think uh we have to stop\cb1 \
\cb3 looking\cb1 \
\cb3 to men to be the reason we submit and\cb1 \
\cb3 start looking\cb1 \
\cb3 to us because we have to stop thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 of it as a negative\cb1 \
\cb3 why is submission a negative i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i should know um\cb1 \
\cb3 are you are you married i used to be i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 divorced but i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 in a committed relationship at this\cb1 \
\cb3 point but i'm on the cliff i'm on the\cb1 \
\cb3 clearance rack so\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i don't know why i don't know why\cb1 \
\cb3 especially in the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 uh well i do my my opinion is we've been\cb1 \
\cb3 the color purple\cb1 \
\cb3 we grew up with this color purple\cb1 \
\cb3 narrative that\cb1 \
\cb3 when black women submit to black male\cb1 \
\cb3 authority you get beat and run running\cb1 \
\cb3 up and\cb1 \
\cb3 that alice walker mess was uh\cb1 \
\cb3 dangerous back then it was divisive back\cb1 \
\cb3 then\cb1 \
\cb3 go search for everybody in the comment\cb1 \
\cb3 section go\cb1 \
\cb3 search do a google search of color\cb1 \
\cb3 purple and look at the\cb1 \
\cb3 time the news articles the magazine\cb1 \
\cb3 articles\cb1 \
\cb3 there's stuff on microfiche papers are\cb1 \
\cb3 written about\cb1 \
\cb3 how dangerous black men felt this was\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be for the culture\cb1 \
\cb3 and then there are other people saying\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it's just it's just a film we're\cb1 \
\cb3 still reaping\cb1 \
\cb3 this crap because a lot of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 never saw\cb1 \
\cb3 some of the stuff they talk about but\cb1 \
\cb3 the color purple has been seen by most\cb1 \
\cb3 black people and that's what\cb1 \
\cb3 tends to kind of hang out in our mind as\cb1 \
\cb3 what the problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 so um anything else before\cb1 \
\cb3 we get to the next caller no i just\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate your content i'm a white\cb1 \
\cb3 mother of a black daughter and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to teach her how to you know be a\cb1 \
\cb3 fbi\cb1 \
\cb3 in training so i appreciate everything\cb1 \
\cb3 you had to say\cb1 \
\cb3 you make me a better uh partner too\cb1 \
\cb3 well not a partner assistant let me\cb1 \
\cb3 correct myself\cb1 \
\cb3 so thank you though all right for\cb1 \
\cb3 everything you do all right\cb1 \
\cb3 all right tiara\cb1 \
\cb3 your sound's not correct yeah i heard\cb1 \
\cb3 what she said i'll get to it in a second\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll get to it in a second ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 wait a minute i've still called before\cb1 \
\cb3 hello hello\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm i'm correct i'm good i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 actually a little under the weather\cb1 \
\cb3 okay what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 since i was a topic of discussion i\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to call in\cb1 \
\cb3 you heard you were a lead-in but the\cb1 \
\cb3 discussion was about submission\cb1 \
\cb3 yes yes i understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 so i wanted to clear a couple things up\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i think in impassioned\cb1 \
\cb3 i came across a bit um aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 and that is not my intention yesterday\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh\cb1 \
\cb3 what how old are you i'm 32.\cb1 \
\cb3 okay great yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 um so i wanted to i think i was trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to get a lot in\cb1 \
\cb3 the conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 in you know a short amount of time that\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought i had\cb1 \
\cb3 um but i don't i was a little amused by\cb1 \
\cb3 the comments saying i'm a feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't i am a feminist i don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 we're equal if i'm calling for help\cb1 \
\cb3 i'd i would not let me let me say this\cb1 \
\cb3 then\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley most black women don't identify\cb1 \
\cb3 as being\cb1 \
\cb3 outwardly feminist okay but if it walks\cb1 \
\cb3 like a duck quacks like a duck has\cb1 \
\cb3 feathers because\cb1 \
\cb3 i i just listened ma yeah the things\cb1 \
\cb3 you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying were right out of the feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 handbook\cb1 \
\cb3 well you know what i was listening to\cb1 \
\cb3 our conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 over and again today and\cb1 \
\cb3 what i am battling is the fact that\cb1 \
\cb3 when i see my sisters black women\cb1 \
\cb3 look miserable look they like they\cb1 \
\cb3 haven't progressed\cb1 \
\cb3 every time i encounter them they're\cb1 \
\cb3 angry they're bitter\cb1 \
\cb3 they want a birken bag but have a\cb1 \
\cb3 walmart why is that your cross to bear\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i'm trying to once you\cb1 \
\cb3 were talking about it i was like why do\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 i have that i said it earlier maybe you\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't hear it it's\cb1 \
\cb3 it's it's success it's it's survivor\cb1 \
\cb3 guilt\cb1 \
\cb3 you grew up in a two-parent household\cb1 \
\cb3 yes\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you had a mother and father where did\cb1 \
\cb3 you go to college\cb1 \
\cb3 university of akron right uh and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 32\cb1 \
\cb3 and how tall are you i'm 5 10. dress\cb1 \
\cb3 size\cb1 \
\cb3 uh six right and you're a dancer\cb1 \
\cb3 a dancer are you do you dance\cb1 \
\cb3 no i don't dance at all i've never\cb1 \
\cb3 danced in my life um\cb1 \
\cb3 well are you in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 uh and i'm in shape yes i work nightly\cb1 \
\cb3 all right\cb1 \
\cb3 so most people would\cb1 \
\cb3 you look at most black women they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have your experience\cb1 \
\cb3 you you quote unquote made it say and\cb1 \
\cb3 what we tell people in the black\cb1 \
\cb3 community\cb1 \
\cb3 is to feel guilty because they made it\cb1 \
\cb3 and i say listen yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 your mother and father didn't do what\cb1 \
\cb3 they did to put you in the position for\cb1 \
\cb3 you to take on burdens that you didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 live\cb1 \
\cb3 i never i never thought of it that way\cb1 \
\cb3 of course not because\cb1 \
\cb3 we we happily keep survivors guilt on\cb1 \
\cb3 successful people\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why when the first thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 happened when the black man make it\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody oh man hook me up\cb1 \
\cb3 we the only race that does that\cb1 \
\cb3 and don't you don't would you agree with\cb1 \
\cb3 me that in our progression\cb1 \
\cb3 as black people to get better that we do\cb1 \
\cb3 have to help others\cb1 \
\cb3 or do we just how about this where's\cb1 \
\cb3 your last what was your last\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 uh four years ago how long did it last\cb1 \
\cb3 about five to six but there was multiple\cb1 \
\cb3 breakups\cb1 \
\cb3 five to six what oh years\cb1 \
\cb3 why didn't you guys get married\cb1 \
\cb3 so he was older much older\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not an excuse that is an excuse\cb1 \
\cb3 but i was going to say with that he was\cb1 \
\cb3 an alcoholic\cb1 \
\cb3 and i with no experience didn't really\cb1 \
\cb3 understand it to that degree\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but see when you say he was older\cb1 \
\cb3 then being older had nothing to do with\cb1 \
\cb3 alcoholism\cb1 \
\cb3 well i don't think i would have i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think i would have\cb1 \
\cb3 stayed as long as i did if you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 how did your parents meet him\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah they hated him all right then but\cb1 \
\cb3 then they hated them at the beginning\cb1 \
\cb3 but then\cb1 \
\cb3 they enjoyed them all right after we've\cb1 \
\cb3 been together my ultimate point is\cb1 \
\cb3 this tell me\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a very strong personality\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah which is kind of a feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 handbook so\cb1 \
\cb3 um you wouldn't do well with a guy like\cb1 \
\cb3 myself because i'm not going to allow\cb1 \
\cb3 you to question me like you like the\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not gonna answer all these questions\cb1 \
\cb3 all day long i got [ __ ] to do\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't have time to keep explaining\cb1 \
\cb3 myself to you and i don't need your\cb1 \
\cb3 and what i what i need to get done does\cb1 \
\cb3 not need your 100\cb1 \
\cb3 buy-in\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah see i can't even get see\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to you want to talk back and\cb1 \
\cb3 forth with me and that's fine\cb1 \
\cb3 and that really does you really do\cb1 \
\cb3 operate more like a woman who's a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of feminists like we're equals\cb1 \
\cb3 but i just wanna when i try to interject\cb1 \
\cb3 is only because i'm not clear on what\cb1 \
\cb3 you're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 because i think you're equating our\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation here to a conversation i\cb1 \
\cb3 would have with a spouse\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i am because you are who you are\cb1 \
\cb3 see that's one of the big mistakes one\cb1 \
\cb3 of the biggest misnomers with black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking you can turn [ __ ] on and off\cb1 \
\cb3 you are who you are\cb1 \
\cb3 if you watch my show you will hear black\cb1 \
\cb3 women all the time say well i'll submit\cb1 \
\cb3 to the right person no you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're if you're if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 uncooperative you're uncooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 you are who you are okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but when that's all about that's all of\cb1 \
\cb3 us\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i agree with you you are who you\cb1 \
\cb3 are all the time\cb1 \
\cb3 but i think in my when i think about\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 platform you have i thought it was to\cb1 \
\cb3 get perspectives of women\cb1 \
\cb3 not to just have women say yes\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever you well you get perspectives\cb1 \
\cb3 of women but here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 do you talk to more women or do i talk\cb1 \
\cb3 to more women\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i talk to more women oh really\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you mean\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you doing for a living oh i i\cb1 \
\cb3 run an online\cb1 \
\cb3 business okay what are you doing what do\cb1 \
\cb3 you talk to these women\cb1 \
\cb3 well i thought well i mean in everyday\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah we see i'm a 51 year old man\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on hold on yeah oh sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 sorry go ahead i want to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 why you how you feel like you talk to\cb1 \
\cb3 more women than i do\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i think because of my whole life all\cb1 \
\cb3 my friends cause\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 32 i'm 51. that's true\cb1 \
\cb3 20 years old see that's what i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 and\cb1 \
\cb3 the arrogance of that comment you\cb1 \
\cb3 sitting here listening to a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 who has a show on youtube that has 5 000\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 talking every night and for the last six\cb1 \
\cb3 months i've talked\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been talking to women for years you\cb1 \
\cb3 can just go take a glance i talk\cb1 \
\cb3 i talk to more women i talk to more\cb1 \
\cb3 women and i work with more women women\cb1 \
\cb3 pay me for my advice\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm 20 years older than you and i've\cb1 \
\cb3 been doing this\cb1 \
\cb3 since 1989.\cb1 \
\cb3 okay throughout life i thought you meant\cb1 \
\cb3 currently right now in the state of\cb1 \
\cb3 even right now i talk to more women than\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 i got four women on the platform and\cb1 \
\cb3 three trying to get in\cb1 \
\cb3 okay that's not hard ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 no i believe you if you say that is true\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe that but you're sitting right\cb1 \
\cb3 here looking at and i'm like okay\cb1 \
\cb3 all right all your comments the the\cb1 \
\cb3 comments you have\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the here's let me let me answer\cb1 \
\cb3 the first swing i was trying to get to\cb1 \
\cb3 because yeah ultimately um\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about uh you look at your\cb1 \
\cb3 sisters and this and that\cb1 \
\cb3 and so downtrodden are you happy\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i i i am youthful okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um are you romantically happy\cb1 \
\cb3 well i think you would have to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 someone excuse me should be romantic\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not i'm not with anyone right and\cb1 \
\cb3 you haven't been with anybody for how\cb1 \
\cb3 long\cb1 \
\cb3 for three to four years yeah that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 problem\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so that's i've dated in those years\cb1 \
\cb3 i haven't been\cb1 \
\cb3 dating but dating does not equate to a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 and see that's another thing we do very\cb1 \
\cb3 well in black community we can start\cb1 \
\cb3 very well we do three to six months [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 very well\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't do long term well and\cb1 \
\cb3 ultimately my point is\cb1 \
\cb3 if you really want to help the black\cb1 \
\cb3 women that you say who look so\cb1 \
\cb3 unhappy you help them by becoming a\cb1 \
\cb3 happy world it's like people who say\cb1 \
\cb3 they want the black community to survive\cb1 \
\cb3 well the\cb1 \
\cb3 way you make the black community survive\cb1 \
\cb3 is a did you go marry a black man and\cb1 \
\cb3 make some black babies\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and that's how you help us all and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how you know\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how you help the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 ultimately you want to help them\cb1 \
\cb3 give them something to aspire to\cb1 \
\cb3 especially when women look at you and\cb1 \
\cb3 say well why can't she get it done\cb1 \
\cb3 if she came from a two-parent household\cb1 \
\cb3 and she's attractive and this if she\cb1 \
\cb3 can't get it done why can't i\cb1 \
\cb3 if she's if she's saying some of the\cb1 \
\cb3 same things what are my shots\cb1 \
\cb3 i just feel that all my friends who are\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful black women who\cb1 \
\cb3 have their own businesses and a variety\cb1 \
\cb3 of states\cb1 \
\cb3 all of them i don't see myself in them\cb1 \
\cb3 they both\cb1 \
\cb3 all of them don't come from a two-parent\cb1 \
\cb3 home don't come from the\cb1 \
\cb3 two what does that mean though\cb1 \
\cb3 that both my parents were married and\cb1 \
\cb3 are still married both\cb1 \
\cb3 maternal and patri i get it but that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're you have friends who own\cb1 \
\cb3 businesses in a variety of states so\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in a different category\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't see yourself in them\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning what\cb1 \
\cb3 me not i don't see myself in them\cb1 \
\cb3 they're my friends so i do into a degree\cb1 \
\cb3 but i\cb1 \
\cb3 i see a pain there that isn't reflective\cb1 \
\cb3 to any pain that i carry about black\cb1 \
\cb3 people okay but\cb1 \
\cb3 but that's fine but what is your\cb1 \
\cb3 two-parent household\cb1 \
\cb3 what benefit is it yielding you where's\cb1 \
\cb3 your husband and kids\cb1 \
\cb3 that's true where my husband and kids i\cb1 \
\cb3 was just like what you said\cb1 \
\cb3 on your shows that i watched previously\cb1 \
\cb3 i\cb1 \
\cb3 was in the notion that when i clock in\cb1 \
\cb3 and say i want a man that's when i go\cb1 \
\cb3 get one but that's\cb1 \
\cb3 my opponent see you're right that's my\cb1 \
\cb3 point so you are but see what i need you\cb1 \
\cb3 to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 is you are them\cb1 \
\cb3 see you didn't you didn't identify with\cb1 \
\cb3 the feminist and you and you come acro\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have all the feminist talking\cb1 \
\cb3 points you just don't have the\cb1 \
\cb3 membership card\cb1 \
\cb3 and there's no way to put it and there's\cb1 \
\cb3 really no way\cb1 \
\cb3 it would make a lot of sense to say you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 i got a bunch of friends who are paint\cb1 \
\cb3 phds\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd yeah entrepreneurs dog owners\cb1 \
\cb3 and everything else\cb1 \
\cb3 single as french toast and you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 one of them\cb1 \
\cb3 you are just like them as far as out see\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i my business is about outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 not about process you like to talk a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 about process\cb1 \
\cb3 i get to the outcome and your outcome is\cb1 \
\cb3 the same\cb1 \
\cb3 you have you had the last relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 was four years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 you can date and deal with man but\cb1 \
\cb3 you're no closer to being someone's wife\cb1 \
\cb3 today as you were four years ago you\cb1 \
\cb3 said you had a five-year relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 with a man who was older\cb1 \
\cb3 and all those other kind of things and\cb1 \
\cb3 your mother and father did not like him\cb1 \
\cb3 well apparently your two-parent\cb1 \
\cb3 household\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't help you not you didn't listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 them so what's the point\cb1 \
\cb3 true true this is why i always say\cb1 \
\cb3 therapy because black women are your own\cb1 \
\cb3 counsel\cb1 \
\cb3 you sit around and talk to each other\cb1 \
\cb3 assuming that you can fix one another\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're all broken yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i i definitely agree with you on that\cb1 \
\cb3 so but i also think that in my mind\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't want to be just a housewife and\cb1 \
\cb3 i saw both of my grandparents there and\cb1 \
\cb3 my mother why what do you mean just i\cb1 \
\cb3 just didn't want it i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 why not i don't mean to like that i\cb1 \
\cb3 think first of all\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right i didn't mean it that way i\cb1 \
\cb3 just wanted something else to bring\cb1 \
\cb3 to the table i just wanted something\cb1 \
\cb3 else to have another cop have another\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation about something else\cb1 \
\cb3 but what what hold on hold on listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen yeah yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm here what what okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you want that's what you wanted what do\cb1 \
\cb3 men want\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right men didn't i\cb1 \
\cb3 i just came to that realization watching\cb1 \
\cb3 that that men could care less what you\cb1 \
\cb3 have to say no that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 well and that's why so that's why my 20s\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought i wanted to build something so\cb1 \
\cb3 when i got to the table i could say well\cb1 \
\cb3 look this is what i have\cb1 \
\cb3 look what i have offering\cb1 \
\cb3 but that's the thing i'm moving\cb1 \
\cb3 operating off a thing that maybe that is\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is and i need you to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand you don't have time to be\cb1 \
\cb3 worrying about the sisters who have so\cb1 \
\cb3 much pain because your [ __ ] ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 together\cb1 \
\cb3 [Laughter]\cb1 \
\cb3 okay that's why i was telling you you're\cb1 \
\cb3 a feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 you're taking stop saying listen don't\cb1 \
\cb3 tell me what to not say\cb1 \
\cb3 who the hell you think you're talking to\cb1 \
\cb3 i think you're giving me a title i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 i just give you a title that fits\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not an insult ma'am a feminist you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay go look up what a feminist you\cb1 \
\cb3 advocate for women\cb1 \
\cb3 women's position and it's a women's\cb1 \
\cb3 first that's a freaking feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know one thing the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 like i said at the beginning\cb1 \
\cb3 are susceptible to feminism early ons\cb1 \
\cb3 14 to 21 that's when they get you and\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 when most girls are learning how to how\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 court and strategically mate you're\cb1 \
\cb3 learning how to\cb1 \
\cb3 not to be independent from your man not\cb1 \
\cb3 interdependent\cb1 \
\cb3 so this is when you get off to college\cb1 \
\cb3 and when becky marisol and malinga go in\cb1 \
\cb3 their freshman and sophomore year\cb1 \
\cb3 slutting it up sport [ __ ] their way\cb1 \
\cb3 through college\cb1 \
\cb3 and their junior year they square up and\cb1 \
\cb3 get a fiance\cb1 \
\cb3 and you ladies are breaking up from your\cb1 \
\cb3 boyfriends\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're gonna go move somewhere\cb1 \
\cb3 and have this [ __ ] job that you call\cb1 \
\cb3 a career\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not a vp of marketing most 80\cb1 \
\cb3 plus percent of women have\cb1 \
\cb3 jobs and you have jobs\cb1 \
\cb3 all the way through until about 29 you\cb1 \
\cb3 turn around look\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're unfit to be with anyone else\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 that and black women have been duped by\cb1 \
\cb3 feminism\cb1 \
\cb3 because white women the feminists don't\cb1 \
\cb3 even move like you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 and you get to the point to where you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying well look i have all these things\cb1 \
\cb3 and the thing is uh yeah where's the\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperation with the man\cb1 \
\cb3 show me can you like can you cook\cb1 \
\cb3 are you a great cook huh uh i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 vegetarian\cb1 \
\cb3 then i think i am a great cook then you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't cook\cb1 \
\cb3 oh cheese i mean i'm a man i want i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're a vegetarian yes then\cb1 \
\cb3 it means your family's gonna have to be\cb1 \
\cb3 a vegetarian i want meat\cb1 \
\cb3 no they don't i haven't cooked any meat\cb1 \
\cb3 in about\cb1 \
\cb3 eight years all right so so so\cb1 \
\cb3 effectively\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're you're automatically saying\cb1 \
\cb3 that if i'm going to cook for a man i\cb1 \
\cb3 automatically don't know how to cook\cb1 \
\cb3 some of the things that most men in this\cb1 \
\cb3 country would eat\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i think i know i can master\cb1 \
\cb3 cooking a steak again quite quickly\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah but see you we willing to do\cb1 \
\cb3 that when\cb1 \
\cb3 after you're married no i i'm willing to\cb1 \
\cb3 do that\cb1 \
\cb3 now well the thing my point is\cb1 \
\cb3 non-black women are taught to value\cb1 \
\cb3 their men to prepare for their men\cb1 \
\cb3 before they get them that's why they get\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 black women are taught to deal with a\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 at best you know how to have sex with us\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't know how to interact with us\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with us that's why even having\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations like this\cb1 \
\cb3 um can be tense and contentious i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have arguments like this for non-black\cb1 \
\cb3 people non-black women\cb1 \
\cb3 but are you on a platform like this\cb1 \
\cb3 asking for perspectives of\cb1 \
\cb3 women i think you would\cb1 \
\cb3 well again you're wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 i've lived my life you haven't\cb1 \
\cb3 see shame insults guilt\cb1 \
\cb3 the need to be right sign\cb1 \
\cb3 core parts of a black female pathology\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have a real\cb1 \
\cb3 need to be right to where you'll even\cb1 \
\cb3 make assumptions about i know\cb1 \
\cb3 and how can i and that's why i say you\cb1 \
\cb3 think you talk to more women i know\cb1 \
\cb3 women better than you because i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 telling you about you and i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 you but why am i reading you\cb1 \
\cb3 because i know you because i know black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 people don't just tune into my show\cb1 \
\cb3 because i have a suit and lights\cb1 \
\cb3 no i've learned a lot there's something\cb1 \
\cb3 missing because\cb1 \
\cb3 let's be honest when you look in the\cb1 \
\cb3 mirror\cb1 \
\cb3 you never thought you'd be single as\cb1 \
\cb3 french toast at this age with no viable\cb1 \
\cb3 prospects\cb1 \
\cb3 for a valuable believer absolutely you\cb1 \
\cb3 thought you would you didn't think you\cb1 \
\cb3 would be\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're right i never would have\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly and if women look at you and say\cb1 \
\cb3 well if\cb1 \
\cb3 it's going that way for her what about\cb1 \
\cb3 me when i'm not this way\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's because of what you said why\cb1 \
\cb3 so many black women are by themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 your attitude and ability to cooperate\cb1 \
\cb3 aggression masculinity and weight you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have to wait but you have\cb1 \
\cb3 many of the other ones okay\cb1 \
\cb3 i hear you i accidentally you know and\cb1 \
\cb3 all i'm saying is\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm saying that no one's coming to\cb1 \
\cb3 save black women\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to get therapy and this and\cb1 \
\cb3 realize this\cb1 \
\cb3 one the black community was lied to\cb1 \
\cb3 black women would black women bought\cb1 \
\cb3 third wave feminism\cb1 \
\cb3 like it or not the history is settled\cb1 \
\cb3 in the 60s black women decided to side\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 the government and benefits\cb1 \
\cb3 and and bla the black separation has\cb1 \
\cb3 been\cb1 \
\cb3 going uh ever since black men and black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 are almost two different groups right\cb1 \
\cb3 now\cb1 \
\cb3 give you an example black women vote 98\cb1 \
\cb3 99 for the democratic party\cb1 \
\cb3 black men are far more voting their\cb1 \
\cb3 interests\cb1 \
\cb3 so at the end of the day\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it going to because you said it\cb1 \
\cb3 i asked a question\cb1 \
\cb3 what was it going to take for you to\cb1 \
\cb3 happily submit to a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 it's authority and you said oh\cb1 \
\cb3 that's easy i was raised in a two-parent\cb1 \
\cb3 household\cb1 \
\cb3 well no i was right yeah by submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 right but that doesn't make you one yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i think guys a mother\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i do i would all right so if i were\cb1 \
\cb3 to ask your\cb1 \
\cb3 ex the guy with the five years if you\cb1 \
\cb3 were submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah all right okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 then at 32\cb1 \
\cb3 why have you not had a longer\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 have you just been on the market why\cb1 \
\cb3 transition to l.a and\cb1 \
\cb3 it was quite different than i expected\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know what does that mean i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 coming from ohio\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so i was a little naive to uh\cb1 \
\cb3 what to expect in california i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know what that means and not there's\cb1 \
\cb3 anybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 could you translate yeah um i think it's\cb1 \
\cb3 a bit\cb1 \
\cb3 a bit a lot more completely more\cb1 \
\cb3 fast-paced than\cb1 \
\cb3 than ohio i think i was doing\cb1 \
\cb3 very well in ohio and being doing very\cb1 \
\cb3 well in ohio means nothing in california\cb1 \
\cb3 right um\cb1 \
\cb3 but you got we found that out quite\cb1 \
\cb3 quickly no so you don't have guys\cb1 \
\cb3 approaching you trying to date you\cb1 \
\cb3 oh no that's not the case yes i did it\cb1 \
\cb3 as soon as i landed right but my focus\cb1 \
\cb3 is on\cb1 \
\cb3 building a life here\cb1 \
\cb3 and what does that mean what does that\cb1 \
\cb3 mean getting finances together getting\cb1 \
\cb3 my place together\cb1 \
\cb3 getting situated have i moved here with\cb1 \
\cb3 no one\cb1 \
\cb3 you mean being independent being\cb1 \
\cb3 completely independent completely away\cb1 \
\cb3 from every\cb1 \
\cb3 family right right so again\cb1 \
\cb3 yes black women have more your\cb1 \
\cb3 experience\cb1 \
\cb3 this is not what women are supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 do women are the social of the group\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean no disrespect man but yeah what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you\cb1 \
\cb3 what big picture what do you do for a\cb1 \
\cb3 living\cb1 \
\cb3 what's your career path vertical yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 oh what it where i'm going no no this\cb1 \
\cb3 was what your job title\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i own a couple of online businesses\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so\cb1 \
\cb3 in what in what particular industries\cb1 \
\cb3 one is in fashion um\cb1 \
\cb3 and one one is in development i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 really speak on that\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's on the i'm not trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 really but what i'm trying to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 is many women don't have careers they\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 jobs even if they and that's the point\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 i get what you're going with that why\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah it's like you're putting all this\cb1 \
\cb3 time into nothing yes\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah i watch my ex-mother-in-law\cb1 \
\cb3 die\cb1 \
\cb3 from being a workaholic and see what i\cb1 \
\cb3 said earlier ashley is black women\cb1 \
\cb3 like yourself are happier\cb1 \
\cb3 more content doing that because in\cb1 \
\cb3 places that they don't want to talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 they know they're not good in long-term\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 i just don't feel like that's my story\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm very happy to\cb1 \
\cb3 all right what's the longest\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship you've had since\cb1 \
\cb3 you've been in la four years so dating\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i haven't had a relationship i've\cb1 \
\cb3 just dated\cb1 \
\cb3 the longest person i dated i would have\cb1 \
\cb3 to think about that because honestly the\cb1 \
\cb3 type of guys\cb1 \
\cb3 that you said you had a relationship you\cb1 \
\cb3 were off and on for five years and that\cb1 \
\cb3 that could mean anything was he\cb1 \
\cb3 were you guys in the same city oh we\cb1 \
\cb3 were yes this is when i was back in ohio\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and you and when did it what year\cb1 \
\cb3 did it end\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it's 2020. i ended in 2028.\cb1 \
\cb3 so 2015 2016. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 and you guys are off and on correct\cb1 \
\cb3 so how long were you guys really\cb1 \
\cb3 together\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a tough one because we were all\cb1 \
\cb3 off and on meaning i moved away for\cb1 \
\cb3 eight months out of state\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why that's why i asked for you\cb1 \
\cb3 guys in the same place see i know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm doing no we know we were\cb1 \
\cb3 but i moved out but but but but you\cb1 \
\cb3 moved out of state that that put\cb1 \
\cb3 distance\cb1 \
\cb3 that's my right that wasn't off so\cb1 \
\cb3 listen\cb1 \
\cb3 mm-hmm what was the relationship you had\cb1 \
\cb3 before this one\cb1 \
\cb3 before the one we're currently talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about uh-huh with another guy\cb1 \
\cb3 in ohio how long ago how long did it\cb1 \
\cb3 last\cb1 \
\cb3 that one was like a year and a half\cb1 \
\cb3 uh-huh\cb1 \
\cb3 and what about before that one\cb1 \
\cb3 and before that one\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing i i had one but it was probably\cb1 \
\cb3 under a year\cb1 \
\cb3 right so under a year a year and a half\cb1 \
\cb3 that's two and a half years\cb1 \
\cb3 and even if i give you half the time\cb1 \
\cb3 which is a push for this five-year\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am you've had about four years worth\cb1 \
\cb3 of relationships in 32 years\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not that's just a little bit over\cb1 \
\cb3 10 percent of your life you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have a track record of communica\cb1 \
\cb3 of cooperating with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 but see to you you talk as if\cb1 \
\cb3 i was raised by mom and she submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 and this and that and i could just turn\cb1 \
\cb3 this switch\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm telling you no no right\cb1 \
\cb3 but i know i'm right that's why but this\cb1 \
\cb3 i just want to say this though when you\cb1 \
\cb3 keep saying that yes you're completely\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 but i didn't have that thought process\cb1 \
\cb3 at 20 when i should have been in college\cb1 \
\cb3 looking for a man\cb1 \
\cb3 i wasn't thinking about that i'm 25. i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 still but you're you're right\cb1 \
\cb3 i just realized that when you said it\cb1 \
\cb3 right and that's the sad part\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the sad part because so many\cb1 \
\cb3 black women don't realize\cb1 \
\cb3 until they're in the danger zone when\cb1 \
\cb3 it's\cb1 \
\cb3 almost over that you have the\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 skills of a 19 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 most black women in your age range have\cb1 \
\cb3 the relationship skills\cb1 \
\cb3 of someone between the age of 18 and 22.\cb1 \
\cb3 they still date like that they still\cb1 \
\cb3 move like that they have the same\cb1 \
\cb3 expectations\cb1 \
\cb3 and the thing is the only way to get\cb1 \
\cb3 caught\cb1 \
\cb3 up is to have get some therapy to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 why the court because black folk black\cb1 \
\cb3 women in particular you\cb1 \
\cb3 run from relationship with with with\cb1 \
\cb3 suitable black men\cb1 \
\cb3 it's either you deal with guys that are\cb1 \
\cb3 fraught with\cb1 \
\cb3 problems that you really never have to\cb1 \
\cb3 commit to and then you mess around\cb1 \
\cb3 and end up trying to make it work with\cb1 \
\cb3 them or you\cb1 \
\cb3 stick your head into these careers where\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody else is realizing that not\cb1 \
\cb3 being\cb1 \
\cb3 independent interdependent\cb1 \
\cb3 and like you said coming from a\cb1 \
\cb3 two-parent household watching people be\cb1 \
\cb3 interdependent\cb1 \
\cb3 you seem to have gone against your core\cb1 \
\cb3 programming to end up\cb1 \
\cb3 single\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah well that definitely could be the\cb1 \
\cb3 case\cb1 \
\cb3 but when i went through this i really\cb1 \
\cb3 thought that i could\cb1 \
\cb3 oh when i'm ready to have a husband i\cb1 \
\cb3 can get one and i'll explain this for\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a that's right that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 feminist mindset for you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the feminist mindset i get it i\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the feminist mindset it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 that easy\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right right now now in l.a and a\cb1 \
\cb3 market that you said is very competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 even in l.a it doesn't matter la\cb1 \
\cb3 or it could be in des moines it doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 work that way\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why women like that's why uh so\cb1 \
\cb3 many women in your age range\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't understand why they're single\cb1 \
\cb3 they're single because they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not fit for a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's and that's hard to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 so the pain you see with women black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not black men's fault it's their\cb1 \
\cb3 responsibility\cb1 \
\cb3 you i don't you're right and i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think it is that fraud and i don't i\cb1 \
\cb3 want to clarify that i do think that\cb1 \
\cb3 every black woman should be accountable\cb1 \
\cb3 but it doesn't make sense for me or it\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't make sense when i'm looking at\cb1 \
\cb3 it and when i'm seeing it why\cb1 \
\cb3 don't they choose something better when\cb1 \
\cb3 better is out there\cb1 \
\cb3 why do they fix attributes about\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 outwardly but nothing inwardly and what\cb1 \
\cb3 would be the harm\cb1 \
\cb3 in every black man or a lot of black men\cb1 \
\cb3 or some black men\cb1 \
\cb3 or just the black men that look as put\cb1 \
\cb3 together as you\cb1 \
\cb3 why what is the what would be negative\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 approaching that woman or any woman\cb1 \
\cb3 in just a very pleasant way hold on hold\cb1 \
\cb3 on say that\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm a four-year-old i'm just\cb1 \
\cb3 reverting back to what we were talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about what you mentioned earlier today\cb1 \
\cb3 in regards to i shouldn't have to go out\cb1 \
\cb3 my way or kiss ass\cb1 \
\cb3 to a black woman with a bad attitude i\cb1 \
\cb3 said it politely and that's enough\cb1 \
\cb3 so what i'm saying is what is the\cb1 \
\cb3 negative\cb1 \
\cb3 if we both are viewing the same woman\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll tell you what the negative is i'll\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you what the negative is\cb1 \
\cb3 it's negative to my masculine frame i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to kiss your [ __ ] ass\cb1 \
\cb3 and simple and simply that i'm not going\cb1 \
\cb3 to do it i don't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 i'd rather get a white woman and let you\cb1 \
\cb3 st sit over and be by yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 if you think i'm so glad you said that\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no because that's what you thought\cb1 \
\cb3 anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i said it no no no i'm so\cb1 \
\cb3 glad you said why woman because i was\cb1 \
\cb3 going to make the point that\cb1 \
\cb3 black men would be oh they go over the\cb1 \
\cb3 top and that's why i\cb1 \
\cb3 said it because i knew that's what you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't you say no no ma'am i that was\cb1 \
\cb3 that was\cb1 \
\cb3 that was a i crossed you up\cb1 \
\cb3 that ain't what i mean i just said what\cb1 \
\cb3 i knew you would jump on\cb1 \
\cb3 so i i want to know though you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think that's true no it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's something that you would jump\cb1 \
\cb3 on and it would justify why\cb1 \
\cb3 i well he should go ahead he'd be more\cb1 \
\cb3 willing to\cb1 \
\cb3 be uh uh cooperative and understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 of becky than his own black sister who's\cb1 \
\cb3 such and stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 that's [ __ ] black men have gone over\cb1 \
\cb3 bent over their back\cb1 \
\cb3 to try to be uh sympathetic empathetic\cb1 \
\cb3 and all these things and what do we get\cb1 \
\cb3 louder more difficult twerking on our\cb1 \
\cb3 furniture\cb1 \
\cb3 black men are tired of having to kiss\cb1 \
\cb3 your [ __ ] ass\cb1 \
\cb3 to get no cooperation and then\cb1 \
\cb3 no and then to hear and then to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 that we should still do it\cb1 \
\cb3 just because there's no harm in it yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 it is every time a man has to submit and\cb1 \
\cb3 cower tower\cb1 \
\cb3 to someone who's already who thinks who\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't have contempt or disrespect for\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 it lowers him i'm not going to i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not going to lower myself diminish\cb1 \
\cb3 my self-esteem or self-respect to\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody who has no respect and contempt\cb1 \
\cb3 for me\cb1 \
\cb3 do you think all of that before you even\cb1 \
\cb3 approach someone would be there i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me you wouldn't know that by\cb1 \
\cb3 approaching someone\cb1 \
\cb3 and a very charming demeanor you\cb1 \
\cb3 wouldn't know that are you kidding me\cb1 \
\cb3 you knew exactly when you were gonna go\cb1 \
\cb3 over to her are you kidding me see this\cb1 \
\cb3 is what i mean i know this is what i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 i know women better than you\cb1 \
\cb3 because you don't date women you only\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with the women you know\cb1 \
\cb3 you i tell you what you go into male\cb1 \
\cb3 spaces\cb1 \
\cb3 and you listen to them you listen to men\cb1 \
\cb3 one two three\cb1 \
\cb3 four five ten one thousand tell the same\cb1 \
\cb3 story\cb1 \
\cb3 in and out black women treat black men\cb1 \
\cb3 like crap in general\cb1 \
\cb3 we are surprised when you're nice to us\cb1 \
\cb3 stop uh what the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know if what i'm gonna i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna ask some black men wait a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute wait a minute wait a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 are you honestly trying to sit here and\cb1 \
\cb3 tell me that that's you don't believe\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 black men are surprised when black women\cb1 \
\cb3 are nice to them\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i do not believe that no\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my [ __ ] god stop no\cb1 \
\cb3 you stop that's i tell you no no\cb1 \
\cb3 you stop you go to no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no you go to nicole michelle's\cb1 \
\cb3 channel\cb1 \
\cb3 black female influencer nicole michelle\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and listen and go and you go ask\cb1 \
\cb3 that sister\cb1 \
\cb3 what happened when you told your women\cb1 \
\cb3 of your inner beauty movement\cb1 \
\cb3 who's on their feminine journey trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to become the best version of themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 to find a husband\cb1 \
\cb3 and do all their healing and things like\cb1 \
\cb3 this she just asked her group of\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 hey sis here's an exercise just\cb1 \
\cb3 for a day smile every black man you see\cb1 \
\cb3 go ask that black woman what happened\cb1 \
\cb3 when she just asked feminine\cb1 \
\cb3 black women who were trying to become\cb1 \
\cb3 the best versions just ask them to smile\cb1 \
\cb3 that woman was eviscerated for months\cb1 \
\cb3 are this is what i mean you are clueless\cb1 \
\cb3 if you think that the rank and file\cb1 \
\cb3 black man\cb1 \
\cb3 gets decent treatment by the rank and\cb1 \
\cb3 file\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman we are surprised when you're\cb1 \
\cb3 nice to us\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is the problem everybody that's\cb1 \
\cb3 listening there's so many women\cb1 \
\cb3 like ashley who are completely\cb1 \
\cb3 disconnected from the black male\cb1 \
\cb3 experience\cb1 \
\cb3 they have no problem in continuing to\cb1 \
\cb3 ask us\cb1 \
\cb3 for [ __ ] more a little bit more a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit more a little bit more\cb1 \
\cb3 do you not realize what black men have\cb1 \
\cb3 already gone through and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what kind of called me we saying\cb1 \
\cb3 well you need to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 what the what the black woman has gone\cb1 \
\cb3 through what the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 no\cb1 \
\cb3 what's up all right\cb1 \
\cb3 hey joy\cb1 \
\cb3 hi hi kevin how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 really well thank you good what do you\cb1 \
\cb3 got for me do modern women\cb1 \
\cb3 want to submit to me amen\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know i think that\cb1 \
\cb3 um there's i guess in short\cb1 \
\cb3 no um but i think in in our community in\cb1 \
\cb3 the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 the issues that we have in male female\cb1 \
\cb3 romantic relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 related to sort of a woman's way of\cb1 \
\cb3 relating to her man\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know being the boss\cb1 \
\cb3 not feeling comfortable trusting\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a complex one um i think a big part\cb1 \
\cb3 of it and i need to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been married for six years and we\cb1 \
\cb3 have four kids\cb1 \
\cb3 um and i'm a stay-at-home mom which i\cb1 \
\cb3 love\cb1 \
\cb3 um it's a blessing and i'm really happy\cb1 \
\cb3 that congrats that's a good thing\cb1 \
\cb3 six years wow it is i love it i love it\cb1 \
\cb3 um and it comes with its challenges\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously but it's it's\cb1 \
\cb3 a wonderful thing to be experiencing our\cb1 \
\cb3 family this way\cb1 \
\cb3 um but i think for for many black women\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 there's an issue related to\cb1 \
\cb3 um not understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves um and as as women\cb1 \
\cb3 and so not understanding what many\cb1 \
\cb3 people call like the feminine principle\cb1 \
\cb3 and then not understanding the masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 principle as well and i know for me\cb1 \
\cb3 in my marriage there's been a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 learning\cb1 \
\cb3 related to ways i can relate to my\cb1 \
\cb3 husband\cb1 \
\cb3 to empower him that are respectful as he\cb1 \
\cb3 perceives\cb1 \
\cb3 respect um so you mentioned i think with\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the previous callers\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe it was miss ashley who you were\cb1 \
\cb3 just speaking with um\cb1 \
\cb3 you you said a few words that i've heard\cb1 \
\cb3 um from my husband\cb1 \
\cb3 especially early on in terms of you know\cb1 \
\cb3 questioning\cb1 \
\cb3 everything and i'm not saying she did or\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't do that i'm just\cb1 \
\cb3 saying that um for me i really had to\cb1 \
\cb3 um and i'm still in the process of\cb1 \
\cb3 learning the importance of\cb1 \
\cb3 um trust of of tone sometimes\cb1 \
\cb3 um i know now that my tone may seem fine\cb1 \
\cb3 to me you know let's have a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 let's\cb1 \
\cb3 debate this out um but you know for a\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 who is you know a masculine man um\cb1 \
\cb3 sometimes just a too much inflection in\cb1 \
\cb3 your tone can be\cb1 \
\cb3 overwhelming and it can feel\cb1 \
\cb3 disrespectful um and\cb1 \
\cb3 so i think for me needing to really\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 like this is how many men interpret\cb1 \
\cb3 my behavior you know or or the the\cb1 \
\cb3 generals of my behavior this is how they\cb1 \
\cb3 would interpret it um\cb1 \
\cb3 it's been a humbling thing but really\cb1 \
\cb3 productive\cb1 \
\cb3 um in terms of accepting it and then\cb1 \
\cb3 making adjustments women there's so much\cb1 \
\cb3 we can\cb1 \
\cb3 do to get through to our men\cb1 \
\cb3 if we are willing to take a look at\cb1 \
\cb3 ourselves\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you know make those adjustments\cb1 \
\cb3 strategically you know and and one thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i will say um\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin um that you i think you you\cb1 \
\cb3 mentioned something to\cb1 \
\cb3 again miss ashley about um her being\cb1 \
\cb3 or um sort of being who you are\cb1 \
\cb3 um you are sort of being who you are you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't change who you are\cb1 \
\cb3 and so it comes out um and i know for me\cb1 \
\cb3 i\cb1 \
\cb3 love debate i love engaging\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations\cb1 \
\cb3 um i love it and and i don't for me i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't necessarily think there's anything\cb1 \
\cb3 wrong with that in particular maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 there is and that's something i can\cb1 \
\cb3 you know gain insight about um over the\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i think i think there's a time\cb1 \
\cb3 see it's\cb1 \
\cb3 it's time place and manner see like if\cb1 \
\cb3 you were having a dinner party you\cb1 \
\cb3 having a bunch of\cb1 \
\cb3 couples over and you guys were gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 just get into it\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's one thing right um\cb1 \
\cb3 but if it's just you guys one on one it\cb1 \
\cb3 it pop what's the ultimate outcome see\cb1 \
\cb3 sometimes it's not even worth it um it's\cb1 \
\cb3 like well what am i gaining from this\cb1 \
\cb3 we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 this political issue that i really don't\cb1 \
\cb3 care about it was just a point to me but\cb1 \
\cb3 the\cb1 \
\cb3 but the feelings that remain just not\cb1 \
\cb3 worth it\cb1 \
\cb3 something i learned a lot in therapy but\cb1 \
\cb3 but you said something earlier on our\cb1 \
\cb3 romantic relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 and one of the things i think that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 issue in the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 is we need to start with our\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 on respect and grow into romance love\cb1 \
\cb3 we're older romance and love is for 25\cb1 \
\cb3 and under 27 and under when you start\cb1 \
\cb3 getting to our age it's\cb1 \
\cb3 more or less about respect and see it's\cb1 \
\cb3 easier to\cb1 \
\cb3 submit and cooperate with somebody you\cb1 \
\cb3 respect with\cb1 \
\cb3 because love you know that's an emotion\cb1 \
\cb3 that can fluctuate\cb1 \
\cb3 respect tends to stay there but i\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate you calling in and go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 quick\cb1 \
\cb3 oh sorry the last thing i'll say um is\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 there i think there's another element\cb1 \
\cb3 though to um\cb1 \
\cb3 our what you what you say is our\cb1 \
\cb3 pathology i don't know if i totally\cb1 \
\cb3 agree with\cb1 \
\cb3 the use of that word um because it's\cb1 \
\cb3 thrown around a lot when it comes to\cb1 \
\cb3 black folks but\cb1 \
\cb3 um of our behavior um and that\cb1 \
\cb3 i think another aspect is um\cb1 \
\cb3 that historically black women have not\cb1 \
\cb3 in in our context here um and in the\cb1 \
\cb3 colonial context i think throughout the\cb1 \
\cb3 world been able to really depend on our\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 um for you know provision and for\cb1 \
\cb3 protection\cb1 \
\cb3 um and until recently even you know as a\cb1 \
\cb3 people we have not even had full rights\cb1 \
\cb3 in this country i say recently\cb1 \
\cb3 you know a generation generation and a\cb1 \
\cb3 half 50 60 years\cb1 \
\cb3 ago we got them officially um but\cb1 \
\cb3 there's been so much\cb1 \
\cb3 challenge to the black man's ability to\cb1 \
\cb3 really um build and be\cb1 \
\cb3 that masculine presence in the context\cb1 \
\cb3 of this american empire and colonialism\cb1 \
\cb3 worldwide and so some of that gets\cb1 \
\cb3 passed down to generationally\cb1 \
\cb3 you know we see our mothers who maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 have had to be\cb1 \
\cb3 the backbone financially and otherwise\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's very difficult not to have that\cb1 \
\cb3 contempt\cb1 \
\cb3 well i i don't know i don't know i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know if i agree with that one because\cb1 \
\cb3 prior to 1965\cb1 \
\cb3 black people were married at a rate of\cb1 \
\cb3 80 percent that was at the height of jim\cb1 \
\cb3 crow\cb1 \
\cb3 slavery segregation we had black\cb1 \
\cb3 communities\cb1 \
\cb3 we had more black business it's true and\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 we had black economy the difference\cb1 \
\cb3 the difference has been yes black me\cb1 \
\cb3 black we are not the power in this\cb1 \
\cb3 country\cb1 \
\cb3 and you will never supplant the power\cb1 \
\cb3 but if we worked well together back then\cb1 \
\cb3 we have more education more access\cb1 \
\cb3 but our ability to work together is\cb1 \
\cb3 diminished so it cannot just be\cb1 \
\cb3 solely economic\cb1 \
\cb3 very true i i think though that even\cb1 \
\cb3 during that period i mean there were\cb1 \
\cb3 whole books written on\cb1 \
\cb3 this idea by black economists and others\cb1 \
\cb3 who were criticizing for example the\cb1 \
\cb3 dynamic in which the black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 at that time was the leader of her\cb1 \
\cb3 family because she was the economic\cb1 \
\cb3 engine of the family even during that\cb1 \
\cb3 period of time and so i think that\cb1 \
\cb3 the modern woman the black woman was the\cb1 \
\cb3 economic\cb1 \
\cb3 so so hold on hold on yeah um\cb1 \
\cb3 how old are you 29. all right no\cb1 \
\cb3 big daddy was a leader see that a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 depends on who you're reading because\cb1 \
\cb3 black women went off and got the\cb1 \
\cb3 education but they were usually working\cb1 \
\cb3 in a domestic capacity black men\cb1 \
\cb3 were the ones going to get the the jobs\cb1 \
\cb3 in the factories\cb1 \
\cb3 intending to be truck drivers in long\cb1 \
\cb3 haul\cb1 \
\cb3 like me and my grandfather's age made no\cb1 \
\cb3 mistake\cb1 \
\cb3 when he was gone three or four days out\cb1 \
\cb3 of every week\cb1 \
\cb3 he was earning the money throughout the\cb1 \
\cb3 family\cb1 \
\cb3 until around the 70s\cb1 \
\cb3 but from the 40s through the 70s\cb1 \
\cb3 men were making the money see\cb1 \
\cb3 black women have been told that you're\cb1 \
\cb3 the backbone of the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is a mythology that a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 black women have held on to\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's simply not accurate\cb1 \
\cb3 black economists will even back this up\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 this is like it's just like the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 saying black women are the most educated\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're the most enrolled\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not the most graduated and the\cb1 \
\cb3 myth of the black superwoman is\cb1 \
\cb3 something that a lot of black women hold\cb1 \
\cb3 on to\cb1 \
\cb3 yet in their own personal lives\cb1 \
\cb3 have nothing in line with these\cb1 \
\cb3 mythological creatures that they\cb1 \
\cb3 supposedly revere so i can't give you\cb1 \
\cb3 that black women were\cb1 \
\cb3 where the with the financial backbone of\cb1 \
\cb3 the entire family\cb1 \
\cb3 nah that's more that color purple and\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and we seem to have an internet\cb1 \
\cb3 issues but appreciate you calling in mom\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you thank you yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 you know and see the reason i push back\cb1 \
\cb3 on that step is it's more of that same\cb1 \
\cb3 old rhetoric those talking points\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's like no\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like you know how much money were\cb1 \
\cb3 you putting in the family when you were\cb1 \
\cb3 going to wash white people's floors\cb1 \
\cb3 and take care of their kids that was not\cb1 \
\cb3 high paid money\cb1 \
\cb3 high paid labor\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah black people see i don't i think\cb1 \
\cb3 black women need to really go back and\cb1 \
\cb3 understand who their men\cb1 \
\cb3 are what do you know about black men\cb1 \
\cb3 that wouldn't talk to you by white\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 go study the greenwood district in tulsa\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm from oklahoma\cb1 \
\cb3 go study actual black towns that\cb1 \
\cb3 anyway what's going on man we have\cb1 \
\cb3 internet problems over here\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's here's another thing let me\cb1 \
\cb3 let me also go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 completely push back women who come\cb1 \
\cb3 across\cb1 \
\cb3 the border illegally\cb1 \
\cb3 hispanic men earn less than black men\cb1 \
\cb3 yet they don't have the same problem\cb1 \
\cb3 with their women and black men have\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's not economic\cb1 \
\cb3 not not in the whole anyway um\cb1 \
\cb3 let's see crystal\cb1 \
\cb3 crystal hello hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hi what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 barely you're away from the phone so\cb1 \
\cb3 i can what do you got\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for having me um so i really\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 briefly talk i'm not going to take too\cb1 \
\cb3 much of everybody's time\cb1 \
\cb3 um but i wanted to talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 well first of all everybody in here all\cb1 \
\cb3 the women in here are\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely beautiful but one thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley said\cb1 \
\cb3 miss ashley said that really stood out\cb1 \
\cb3 to me\cb1 \
\cb3 was the comment about and housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 and how she feels i i actually took\cb1 \
\cb3 offense to that and i'm going to tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you why i took offense to it\cb1 \
\cb3 um because i was\cb1 \
\cb3 a housewife at one point i'm in my\cb1 \
\cb3 career now\cb1 \
\cb3 but in the beginning of our marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been married for 11 years actually\cb1 \
\cb3 going on 12 years next year\cb1 \
\cb3 we decided when we had our first child\cb1 \
\cb3 that i would\cb1 \
\cb3 stay at home and that was my decision i\cb1 \
\cb3 was already in my career\cb1 \
\cb3 and i decided to take a break and\cb1 \
\cb3 um that was one of the hardest jobs i've\cb1 \
\cb3 ever had\cb1 \
\cb3 yes and i don't think a lot of women\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 um how much maturity you need to have\cb1 \
\cb3 in order to say to yourself you know i\cb1 \
\cb3 am going to put my career on hold for\cb1 \
\cb3 this beautiful baby boy you know and i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of uh women\cb1 \
\cb3 have that experience i do understand i\cb1 \
\cb3 did get married young i\cb1 \
\cb3 went to college i met my husband in\cb1 \
\cb3 college i got married at 23.\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 34 right now so i do understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 my experience is a little bit different\cb1 \
\cb3 from my peers i get that\cb1 \
\cb3 but one one thing i will say that\cb1 \
\cb3 an older woman who is a feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 and she explained to me that the true\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning behind feminism is choice\cb1 \
\cb3 right and i will say that\cb1 \
\cb3 my choice was a traditional route and\cb1 \
\cb3 her choice is not but don't knock\cb1 \
\cb3 my choice yeah you heard you heard me\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of perk up when she said that\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm like we devalue\cb1 \
\cb3 the most valuable role being a housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 and raising children\cb1 \
\cb3 the hand that rocks the cradle rules the\cb1 \
\cb3 world absolutely\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know when we decided to have my\cb1 \
\cb3 second when we decided to have our\cb1 \
\cb3 our second child we have two boys by the\cb1 \
\cb3 way um\cb1 \
\cb3 nine and eleven i'm sorry we've been\cb1 \
\cb3 married for eleven years nine and five\cb1 \
\cb3 um i decided to take another break as\cb1 \
\cb3 well because now i have two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know i just\cb1 \
\cb3 i always felt like okay well since i\cb1 \
\cb3 did take a traditional route a lot of my\cb1 \
\cb3 peers look at me like oh\cb1 \
\cb3 she's odd or she's you know oh well\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what southern women do which\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not true because you know just\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm in texas does not mean that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know a lot of you know women\cb1 \
\cb3 especially black women\cb1 \
\cb3 do that but i will say that\cb1 \
\cb3 if you are a true feminist and if that\cb1 \
\cb3 is your you know that is your right and\cb1 \
\cb3 your past\cb1 \
\cb3 right make sure that you understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 it comes from\cb1 \
\cb3 it stems from choice right because it\cb1 \
\cb3 was something beating down\cb1 \
\cb3 all women that you have to choose this\cb1 \
\cb3 route this route\cb1 \
\cb3 and just because you\cb1 \
\cb3 chose a different route does not mean\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to knock another woman that\cb1 \
\cb3 chose a different route from yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 and so just kind of look at it from that\cb1 \
\cb3 perspective\cb1 \
\cb3 that was just one well i think it didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 sit well with me\cb1 \
\cb3 as a black woman and again i'm in my\cb1 \
\cb3 career\cb1 \
\cb3 you know my boys are older like i said i\cb1 \
\cb3 have a nine and five-year-old fourth\cb1 \
\cb3 grade in kindergarten\cb1 \
\cb3 well let me let me ask you this because\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to make a point that\cb1 \
\cb3 we if we're going to have a black\cb1 \
\cb3 community we need a black community\cb1 \
\cb3 that supports black family instead of\cb1 \
\cb3 your colleagues and contemporaries and\cb1 \
\cb3 female friends\cb1 \
\cb3 making you feel funny or weird about\cb1 \
\cb3 choosing to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 stay-at-home mother or a housewife that\cb1 \
\cb3 should have been supported\cb1 \
\cb3 you know like most communities are happy\cb1 \
\cb3 when that happens in the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like you're being dumb oh you're\cb1 \
\cb3 being dumb you're going to do that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to take a step back girl\cb1 \
\cb3 you know he said he's going to do that\cb1 \
\cb3 he's going to have people all over town\cb1 \
\cb3 and you go all that [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 and they do all this for nine careers\cb1 \
\cb3 and i just read somebody said well man\cb1 \
\cb3 what's your point well my point is\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the point that i'm trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 make because i just read the comment man\cb1 \
\cb3 what is your point\cb1 \
\cb3 well my point is sir that if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 a feminist on the fact that every\cb1 \
\cb3 woman's choice is different\cb1 \
\cb3 that is the point that i'm trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 make i'm not trying to babble\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not trying don't worry about the\cb1 \
\cb3 comment section i don't even look in the\cb1 \
\cb3 comment section it's too much oh okay\cb1 \
\cb3 well i was reading\cb1 \
\cb3 that but i'm not gonna go on and on i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 just saying that support other women's\cb1 \
\cb3 choice\cb1 \
\cb3 right never not everybody's choice is\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be the same just because i\cb1 \
\cb3 decided to go a more traditional route\cb1 \
\cb3 does not mean that every woman has to do\cb1 \
\cb3 that all right crystal i got to get on\cb1 \
\cb3 to the next caller appreciate it you\cb1 \
\cb3 have a good one\cb1 \
\cb3 thanks how about yeah see what we what\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't do\cb1 \
\cb3 is we\cb1 \
\cb3 we talk about black people black people\cb1 \
\cb3 black people understand this and\cb1 \
\cb3 understand it will shout out claudia\cb1 \
\cb3 they shouldn't accept being disrespected\cb1 \
\cb3 and keep kept on moving\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't have a black community without\cb1 \
\cb3 black family\cb1 \
\cb3 and that requires a black father and a\cb1 \
\cb3 black mother\cb1 \
\cb3 a black husband and a black wife we need\cb1 \
\cb3 nuclear families\cb1 \
\cb3 we need we need to support\cb1 \
\cb3 families versus if a young if a couple\cb1 \
\cb3 decides to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 it's easier for them to stay married if\cb1 \
\cb3 they have a community that supports\cb1 \
\cb3 family see we it's too easy to break up\cb1 \
\cb3 as black people\cb1 \
\cb3 back in the day we had church\cb1 \
\cb3 and our neighborhoods if you had a\cb1 \
\cb3 little problem with you if you had a\cb1 \
\cb3 problem\cb1 \
\cb3 you wouldn't talk to maybe you didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 talk to your mother you went to the\cb1 \
\cb3 church or you wouldn't talk to somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 but the community\cb1 \
\cb3 supported you guys working together\cb1 \
\cb3 getting together\cb1 \
\cb3 oh man you need to go there's a movie on\cb1 \
\cb3 always outnumbered always out gun larry\cb1 \
\cb3 lawrence fishburne plays a character who\cb1 \
\cb3 helped his\cb1 \
\cb3 homeboy keep his marriage together\cb1 \
\cb3 because men would\cb1 \
\cb3 hey man you need to go back home man you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to get out back to the house\cb1 \
\cb3 remember when you used to get in trouble\cb1 \
\cb3 by going to somebody you're acting up in\cb1 \
\cb3 the johnson's neighborhood the johnsons\cb1 \
\cb3 could whoop you\cb1 \
\cb3 we had a community right now we got a\cb1 \
\cb3 bunch of individuals and i'ma say this\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies i need you to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 eighty percent of women don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 careers you have\cb1 \
\cb3 jobs and you've been told you've been\cb1 \
\cb3 duped into thinking that this sixty\cb1 \
\cb3 seventy thousand dollar eighty thousand\cb1 \
\cb3 000\cb1 \
\cb3 is is really something and then you look\cb1 \
\cb3 up\cb1 \
\cb3 and you got nobody to left nobody to the\cb1 \
\cb3 right holiday season\cb1 \
\cb3 no family no nothing like everybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 is getting together\cb1 \
\cb3 i think a a huge\cb1 \
\cb3 disservice has been done to the black\cb1 \
\cb3 community my generation in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 but this whole feminism thing and we got\cb1 \
\cb3 to the point\cb1 \
\cb3 where women don't even think they're\cb1 \
\cb3 feminists but you hear the talking\cb1 \
\cb3 points\cb1 \
\cb3 so uh actually i'm gonna bring you back\cb1 \
\cb3 in uh\cb1 \
\cb3 because we're getting uh towards the end\cb1 \
\cb3 but i just had to\cb1 \
\cb3 get some other folks in here too um\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you got\cb1 \
\cb3 oh hold on just just a second let me put\cb1 \
\cb3 this back yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 say again if you came across as wet\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin yeah i can hear you okay okay\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't wanna i'm not here and i didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 want that to come off offensively\cb1 \
\cb3 when i said that about housewives\cb1 \
\cb3 because my grand mothers\cb1 \
\cb3 both were my mom that is not my\cb1 \
\cb3 intention i believe that is the\cb1 \
\cb3 hardest job i've witnessed it\cb1 \
\cb3 and i think you're right that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 backbone of any community\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why that's why that's why i\cb1 \
\cb3 perked up when you said it\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't mean to say like that and maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 i was dealing with it the fact that i\cb1 \
\cb3 looked at\cb1 \
\cb3 them and said oh in my immature mind\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking like oh they're just taking\cb1 \
\cb3 care of kids\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not making any money they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 doing anything\cb1 \
\cb3 life-changing which that is the biggest\cb1 \
\cb3 life-changing thing to do is to raise\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 i had an immature thought when i was\cb1 \
\cb3 younger about that and maybe that came\cb1 \
\cb3 across now but i don't believe that at\cb1 \
\cb3 any degree\cb1 \
\cb3 that that is not the most important job\cb1 \
\cb3 of any\cb1 \
\cb3 household housewife let me ask you one\cb1 \
\cb3 question before you\cb1 \
\cb3 wrap up what is\cb1 \
\cb3 of your time here on this planet yes\cb1 \
\cb3 what is the outcome you want to achieve\cb1 \
\cb3 with your life\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know i want to say i want to get\cb1 \
\cb3 judged for saying it\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i just asked don't anybody know\cb1 \
\cb3 you somebody see your photo\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna you're gonna rip me okay\cb1 \
\cb3 look i just i just want the truth okay\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin i'm gonna tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 i definitely want a husband i definitely\cb1 \
\cb3 want a family\cb1 \
\cb3 but the most thing the thing that i stay\cb1 \
\cb3 up the most about\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to figure out what avenue i could\cb1 \
\cb3 take to better\cb1 \
\cb3 i want black people to be leaps and\cb1 \
\cb3 bounds ahead of where we are\cb1 \
\cb3 in every way i want to see more black\cb1 \
\cb3 people wealthy\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to see more black businesses\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah if no one's ever told you\cb1 \
\cb3 tell me that is not in your power\cb1 \
\cb3 okay honestly it sounds to me\cb1 \
\cb3 like you're going to end up alone\cb1 \
\cb3 and feeling like you lived a life\cb1 \
\cb3 of purpose but you look\cb1 \
\cb3 around and then you get on that sick bed\cb1 \
\cb3 or that death bed\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't nobody coming to visit you ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 no kids coming to visit you\cb1 \
\cb3 your friends if you have them they ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 coming to visit you\cb1 \
\cb3 ashley life is about\cb1 \
\cb3 when you have you ever visited have you\cb1 \
\cb3 have you ever visited a nursing home\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah have you ever sat with people\cb1 \
\cb3 towards the end of their life\cb1 \
\cb3 just listen to this at the foot of 85 90\cb1 \
\cb3 year old people\cb1 \
\cb3 and what they talk about at the end of\cb1 \
\cb3 their life like my grandma\cb1 \
\cb3 aura 104 years old they don't talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 their money\cb1 \
\cb3 their cars they talk they talk about the\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff that they regret\cb1 \
\cb3 that they didn't do\cb1 \
\cb3 your your goals are so big and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not doing the one thing that you could\cb1 \
\cb3 do to help black people\cb1 \
\cb3 make another [ __ ] black person\cb1 \
\cb3 i never looked at it like that of course\cb1 \
\cb3 not because you're selfish\cb1 \
\cb3 selfish yes because it's all about you\cb1 \
\cb3 and what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 no i just thought that a bigger impact\cb1 \
\cb3 would be trying no\cb1 \
\cb3 the bigger impact but again like i said\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all it's all that's very\cb1 \
\cb3 masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 what is what you're talking about you're\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to nest not build\cb1 \
\cb3 you want better for black people you the\cb1 \
\cb3 reason you came across\cb1 \
\cb3 negative when that uh\cb1 \
\cb3 stay at home mother thing is because it\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't really sound like you\cb1 \
\cb3 value that role as much as you do\cb1 \
\cb3 business and commerce and money\cb1 \
\cb3 and economics well\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's coming across like business\cb1 \
\cb3 and money but really i just want\cb1 \
\cb3 to walk down the street and we be seen\cb1 \
\cb3 as equal we're not\cb1 \
\cb3 and we're not where is that where's okay\cb1 \
\cb3 where does\cb1 \
\cb3 where does this utopian society exist or\cb1 \
\cb3 ever exist on this planet\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right it doesn't again\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am no offense but grow up\cb1 \
\cb3 and see it's easier for you to walk down\cb1 \
\cb3 and say my goal\cb1 \
\cb3 when ashley dies and she's 75 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 and she's wasted her years and got\cb1 \
\cb3 powdered eggs she can well spent my life\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to help black for\cb1 \
\cb3 good you got nobody in the house with\cb1 \
\cb3 cats\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am i'm not i'm not joking i'm very\cb1 \
\cb3 serious about what i do this every night\cb1 \
\cb3 not because i i get a thrill out of it\cb1 \
\cb3 i've talked to more black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and i don't think you know anyway i am\cb1 \
\cb3 tired of seeing black women like you\cb1 \
\cb3 die alone living\cb1 \
\cb3 there are some people who die at age 75\cb1 \
\cb3 die at age 25 but aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 buried until 75 if you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 people in your life you're dead\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the holiday season where are\cb1 \
\cb3 your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 zero kids what who are you going to\cb1 \
\cb3 spend christmas with\cb1 \
\cb3 my family who's that\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my whole family my mother my father\cb1 \
\cb3 and my sister my brother\cb1 \
\cb3 what is your sister how is your sister\cb1 \
\cb3 she's 23.\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how does your brother 36 do you have\cb1 \
\cb3 any children\cb1 \
\cb3 uh he doesn't is he married he isn't\cb1 \
\cb3 okay his sister 23 mm-hmm\cb1 \
\cb3 out of college out of college all three\cb1 \
\cb3 of you guys are unmarried no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 oh three i have an older sister as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and she is married with two children\cb1 \
\cb3 all right but the other three it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 three out of four\cb1 \
\cb3 unmarried with kids so your mother and\cb1 \
\cb3 father did what they were supposed to do\cb1 \
\cb3 they made jobs for asses and what they\cb1 \
\cb3 got for their investment is they got\cb1 \
\cb3 one person who decided to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 and have grandchildren\cb1 \
\cb3 and they got three more who just gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 die alone if they keep on this path\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so the family lineage is over once\cb1 \
\cb3 you once you hit the dirt that's it\cb1 \
\cb3 all this stuff that you think your\cb1 \
\cb3 internet business i mean i'm not trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to be pejorative a rude man\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh you're not making microsoft or\cb1 \
\cb3 apple out here\cb1 \
\cb3 you're making enough money to live a a\cb1 \
\cb3 certain lifestyle\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's not like you're getting rich\cb1 \
\cb3 out here\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying anything man i'm just\cb1 \
\cb3 saying this is how most people live in\cb1 \
\cb3 this country\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's better when you have somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 to work with\cb1 \
\cb3 two incomes are better than one i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 so many black women have forgotten how\cb1 \
\cb3 to be in a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 you forget even the good feelings though\cb1 \
\cb3 knowing that i got a standard date on\cb1 \
\cb3 friday\cb1 \
\cb3 i got somebody i can netflix and chill\cb1 \
\cb3 with i actually have a consistent\cb1 \
\cb3 source of sex whether i like it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 it's there guess what i know on\cb1 \
\cb3 christmas\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm getting something from somebody and\cb1 \
\cb3 i got somebody to do something for\cb1 \
\cb3 all you got is the next spreadsheet to\cb1 \
\cb3 the next the next phone call to next to\cb1 \
\cb3 getting other people's lives to try to\cb1 \
\cb3 involve yourself and other stuff to fill\cb1 \
\cb3 up the void that is your life\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's what too many black people\cb1 \
\cb3 have because we are the most\cb1 \
\cb3 unmarried group of people worrying about\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] that's outside of our stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 make another find a man make a baby live\cb1 \
\cb3 a life\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely is my goal that's definitely\cb1 \
\cb3 what all right\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm glad to hear that and the first way\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to do is stop\cb1 \
\cb3 digging stop worrying about your\cb1 \
\cb3 girlfriends start worrying about\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 and focus on the woman in the mirror are\cb1 \
\cb3 you in therapy right now\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm not you needed it you need it\cb1 \
\cb3 man that's not an insult it's not i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't take it as one no\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't you need because in order to be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to work with somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a lot of stuff in your mind that\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to talk out and get out\cb1 \
\cb3 and uh honestly you gotta pay me you\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta you gotta get this out on\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know if you got a journal or\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever because once you get your head\cb1 \
\cb3 in the in the ball game\cb1 \
\cb3 you still got to get out of here and and\cb1 \
\cb3 and date and and what's going on while\cb1 \
\cb3 you while all that time is going on\cb1 \
\cb3 days and hours are going by\cb1 \
\cb3 so i hope i hope to not hear you\cb1 \
\cb3 worrying about other people\cb1 \
\cb3 and uh worrying about black folks\cb1 \
\cb3 position and i'll let no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no yeah i took that burden so\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right i'm on it\cb1 \
\cb3 i ordered that book already i got a\cb1 \
\cb3 notebook i'm ready to make you know\cb1 \
\cb3 see a lot of us get caught up in this\cb1 \
\cb3 martyr\cb1 \
\cb3 jesus christ i'm gonna die for the coach\cb1 \
\cb3 or die for now\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah no that's [ __ ] all right ma\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it all right\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you bye all right everybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 nobody else is uh\cb1 \
\cb3 the other people that was in there that\cb1 \
\cb3 microphones weren't corrected\cb1 \
\cb3 see feminism is the secret weapon of\cb1 \
\cb3 eugenics\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think many sisters realize they\cb1 \
\cb3 are feminists\cb1 \
\cb3 and so a lot of you guys a lot of people\cb1 \
\cb3 here they're like\cb1 \
\cb3 how could you not know well\cb1 \
\cb3 as a man you didn't know you were blue\cb1 \
\cb3 pill\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 we grew up and we were taught scrubs\cb1 \
\cb3 strong independent woman while everybody\cb1 \
\cb3 else is going to do their thing\cb1 \
\cb3 so i listen to women who come over here\cb1 \
\cb3 and get mad at me\cb1 \
\cb3 i challenge any of my female detractors\cb1 \
\cb3 to find a man that's helping more women\cb1 \
\cb3 you ain't got to like the way i do it\cb1 \
\cb3 but show me somebody who's helping more\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what it's about the outcome talk\cb1 \
\cb3 all talk about me how you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 outcome don't say [ __ ] about me unless\cb1 \
\cb3 you're prepared to outwork me\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what you talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 20 21 like i said a couple every month\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm looking for you guys to help me\cb1 \
\cb3 profile at least a couple of months so\cb1 \
\cb3 we can start seeing some more of this\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 because look man you know well why are\cb1 \
\cb3 you worried about this\cb1 \
\cb3 it ain't about me it is not about me\cb1 \
\cb3 it's about trying to get better outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 was for me it's for me don't worry about\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you saying don't worry about me\cb1 \
\cb3 what about you\cb1 \
\cb3 because i find that most of my critics\cb1 \
\cb3 are not happy people\cb1 \
\cb3 because happy people can be like uh well\cb1 \
\cb3 you know take it\cb1 \
\cb3 and take it or leave it i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 but sisters understand something\cb1 \
\cb3 and let if you're not earning in the top\cb1 \
\cb3 15 of earners\cb1 \
\cb3 and i've talked to women who are making\cb1 \
\cb3 seventy thousand dollars six seven\cb1 \
\cb3 thousand dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 and it sounds like a lot in your late\cb1 \
\cb3 twenties early thirties\cb1 \
\cb3 but when you hit 40 it's just empty\cb1 \
\cb3 you buy a home i've seen too many black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 who worked and had money and they bought\cb1 \
\cb3 homes and cars and they died alone\cb1 \
\cb3 alone miserable they drug their kids\cb1 \
\cb3 down\cb1 \
\cb3 if they had a grandkid it was just a\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] cycle i'm tired of seeing it\cb1 \
\cb3 tired of hearing it and um and kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 like ashley i'm tired of seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 black women around this time so unhappy\cb1 \
\cb3 i realize why most of you don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 smile because you're not happy\cb1 \
\cb3 but look the only way you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 end up having a better outcome the only\cb1 \
\cb3 way you're going to get happy\cb1 \
\cb3 is to have your aha moment\cb1 \
\cb3 accountability honesty and acceptance\cb1 \
\cb3 accountability for where you are honesty\cb1 \
\cb3 transparent and direct\cb1 \
\cb3 and acceptance this is where it is how\cb1 \
\cb3 old i am whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 and then move\cb1 \
\cb3 black people aren't cursed we're no\cb1 \
\cb3 different than anybody else we just got\cb1 \

\cb3 that's all i want to know can't we all\cb1 \
\cb3 get along\cb1 \
\cb3 um i don't know remains to be seen\cb1 \
\cb3 but what i'm seeing so far is there is a\cb1 \
\cb3 distinct\cb1 \
\cb3 inability for the modern\cb1 \
\cb3 black man and black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 to make long-lasting relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on it just got warm in here\cb1 \

\cb3 comes along\cb1 \
\cb3 if we don't get the engagement on 50\cb1 \
\cb3 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want to hear that song just\cb1 \
\cb3 keep it up\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm the prize got a cobalt guinness\cb1 \
\cb3 french toast no butter ready thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 my friend\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the legitimate question okay\cb1 \
\cb3 i said it on my instagram earlier today\cb1 \
\cb3 when i said when i\cb1 \
\cb3 announced the title of the stream i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna do\cb1 \
\cb3 uh can white women help black women\cb1 \
\cb3 land a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 and more but more in particular can\cb1 \
\cb3 white women\cb1 \
\cb3 teach black women\cb1 \
\cb3 how to get a high value black man\cb1 \
\cb3 uh we're gonna take it from both sides\cb1 \
\cb3 can white women in general teach black\cb1 \
\cb3 women how to get a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 and can a white woman in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 teach black women how to get a\cb1 \
\cb3 high value black man now\cb1 \
\cb3 moderators on standby here's what i want\cb1 \
\cb3 to understand in the chat room let\cb1 \
\cb3 people say what they have to say\cb1 \
\cb3 as long as they're not being pejorative\cb1 \
\cb3 as long as they're not being insulting\cb1 \
\cb3 but somebody starts talking crazy about\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 time them out and i think is if you\cb1 \
\cb3 talk ignorant i will go ahead and block\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 and why this subject even come up well\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 huh several reasons but one in\cb1 \
\cb3 particular\cb1 \
\cb3 how's the sound how's the audio is that\cb1 \
\cb3 good\cb1 \
\cb3 because the microphones over here you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 let me see we can try to drop the\cb1 \
\cb3 microphone a little bit lower bring it a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit lower maybe you'll do it\cb1 \
\cb3 this came up in particular because\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been thinking about this for a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute i've been thinking about it for a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute and i will tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 um in my group the mix it is\cb1 \
\cb3 it is long i long said that the\cb1 \
\cb3 non-black women are chomping at the bit\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to get into this group okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so i am just responding to what i am\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 number one number two\cb1 \
\cb3 anytime a black man with any kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 money\cb1 \
\cb3 decides to marry out all of a sudden\cb1 \
\cb3 it becomes front page news\cb1 \
\cb3 let's let's just be honest as soon as he\cb1 \
\cb3 as soon as you get married tunisia got\cb1 \
\cb3 him some money he's gonna get him a\cb1 \
\cb3 white girl\cb1 \
\cb3 uh black men know this it's it's it's\cb1 \
\cb3 predictable\cb1 \
\cb3 and many black women will go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 say you know\cb1 \
\cb3 uh we need to study the kardashians and\cb1 \
\cb3 study these people\cb1 \
\cb3 because they are good at landing\cb1 \
\cb3 black men with of means with money\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well the begs the question\cb1 \
\cb3 if that's the case if\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value black men are going to\cb1 \
\cb3 non-black women if high-value black men\cb1 \
\cb3 are not marrying you know kobe when kobe\cb1 \
\cb3 bryant passed\cb1 \
\cb3 you you had women all across social\cb1 \
\cb3 media losing their mind\cb1 \
\cb3 all that all those resources going to\cb1 \
\cb3 another community\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get into it instead of\cb1 \
\cb3 getting uh upset after the choice is\cb1 \
\cb3 made\cb1 \
\cb3 let's ask some questions seeing as\cb1 \
\cb3 though\cb1 \
\cb3 so many black women fear\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i said it fear\cb1 \
\cb3 white women and the competition white\cb1 \
\cb3 women present to you for high value\cb1 \
\cb3 black men\cb1 \
\cb3 see let me go ahead and change this\cb1 \
\cb3 because it's not just average black men\cb1 \
\cb3 that bother you\cb1 \
\cb3 we're going to put in high value black\cb1 \
\cb3 men because that's where the\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what the game really is most of\cb1 \
\cb3 you phds\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd i ain't worried about you know\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman uh you know\cb1 \
\cb3 a white woman grabbing uh tyrone\cb1 \
\cb3 most of y'all ain't worried about that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're like i don't want him no way\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want some dude that ain't about\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 i ain't worried about him so if he goes\cb1 \
\cb3 and gets with\cb1 \
\cb3 you know uh\cb1 \
\cb3 what's that what's that chick um\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what's the typical trope black\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 uh poor black man gets a white woman and\cb1 \
\cb3 she takes care of him yeah we're not\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not talking about that\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not talking about when tyrone goes\cb1 \
\cb3 and gets with honey boo boo's mama\cb1 \
\cb3 we're talking about when a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 who's a\cb1 \
\cb3 a surgeon a cardiologist\cb1 \
\cb3 an oncologist um\cb1 \
\cb3 we're talking about when when these kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of men\cb1 \
\cb3 when you got men of means and you\cb1 \
\cb3 sitting around you're like well dang\cb1 \
\cb3 what happens\cb1 \
\cb3 what happens what happens with those\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of guys um\cb1 \
\cb3 what what happens when those kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 guys um\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out those those are that's what\cb1 \
\cb3 the competition is ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's not act like we don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 what we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 those are the men that women get up the\cb1 \
\cb3 black women get upset\cb1 \
\cb3 about you feel like you lose in one\cb1 \
\cb3 all right well let's tackle it\cb1 \
\cb3 let's tackle it ahead of time if\cb1 \
\cb3 white women are so adept so good\cb1 \
\cb3 at getting high value black men\cb1 \
\cb3 i would think it would make more sense\cb1 \
\cb3 to go to try to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 how they do it how does becky come along\cb1 \
\cb3 in school\cb1 \
\cb3 how does becky long come along and scoop\cb1 \
\cb3 the men that you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot seem to identify when they are\cb1 \
\cb3 in process and then by the time\cb1 \
\cb3 you are recognizing what they should\cb1 \
\cb3 have been they are already\cb1 \
\cb3 married with children with becky\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you see it well\cb1 \
\cb3 oh no let me tell you something i know\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all got in here you saw the child got\cb1 \
\cb3 triggered\cb1 \
\cb3 but get my likes up because we are\cb1 \
\cb3 get my lights up\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 now\cb1 \
\cb3 i should not have to keep asking you\cb1 \
\cb3 guys to hit the like button\cb1 \
\cb3 but i will going\cb1 \
\cb3 get em up get em up get em up get them\cb1 \
\cb3 up get up\cb1 \
\cb3 i should not have to keep asking you\cb1 \
\cb3 guys to do that but i know everybody\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to come in here and say what they\cb1 \
\cb3 have to say\cb1 \
\cb3 but understand something i'm still\cb1 \
\cb3 running this show still running program\cb1 \
\cb3 guys so please do what we need to do\cb1 \
\cb3 now uh jerome says hot topic godfather\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm retired chilling in the philippines\cb1 \
\cb3 making six figures i hope it goes a long\cb1 \
\cb3 way look here man\cb1 \
\cb3 uh i i am not i am i am not trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 uh troll sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm really trying to do is ask a\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 can uh can becky help you\cb1 \
\cb3 get the black man that you can't seem to\cb1 \
\cb3 get because apparently\cb1 \
\cb3 your mama can't do it your sister girl\cb1 \
\cb3 can't do it\cb1 \
\cb3 your cousins couldn't do it and\cb1 \
\cb3 at the end of the day if you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 to her\cb1 \
\cb3 why not hire her you know in military\cb1 \
\cb3 in the military if somebody is doing\cb1 \
\cb3 something better than you\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the smart things to do is to\cb1 \
\cb3 bring one of the generals over\cb1 \
\cb3 and have them teach you that's how you\cb1 \
\cb3 do that\cb1 \
\cb3 see men are pragmatic like that women\cb1 \
\cb3 too much ego and what made me think\cb1 \
\cb3 about this\cb1 \
\cb3 is something that happened on last\cb1 \
\cb3 night's show\cb1 \
\cb3 something happened on last night's show\cb1 \
\cb3 spurred something in me and i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about this because\cb1 \
\cb3 it's been a topic that we should have\cb1 \
\cb3 discussed a long time ago\cb1 \
\cb3 your first time alex alessandra\cb1 \
\cb3 hey ally say again\cb1 \
\cb3 alessandra what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 um okay this is about modern women\cb1 \
\cb3 actually\cb1 \
\cb3 yes okay now i'm going to say something\cb1 \
\cb3 to you i\cb1 \
\cb3 hate these white women uh you're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to have to stop talking like this\cb1 \
\cb3 and everything like that\cb1 \
\cb3 it gets\cb1 \
\cb3 every word every sitting shouldn't be\cb1 \
\cb3 like there\cb1 \
\cb3 like there and there if you're trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk to black women try to help them\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna have to kind of bring that\cb1 \
\cb3 down because that's gonna annoy a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 people but let's keep on moving\cb1 \
\cb3 last night i had a white woman call in\cb1 \
\cb3 and basically say hey\cb1 \
\cb3 how can a how can a white woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to help help\cb1 \
\cb3 go back to the movie malcolm x when a\cb1 \
\cb3 white girl came up to malcolm x when he\cb1 \
\cb3 was on the college\cb1 \
\cb3 on the campus of harvard or somewhere up\cb1 \
\cb3 in the northeast\cb1 \
\cb3 and a white woman came and said you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what how i believe in your cause i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 down i want to help the civil rights uh\cb1 \
\cb3 my my best friends are black whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 how can a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 how can a white person who's never done\cb1 \
\cb3 anything to a black person\cb1 \
\cb3 who doesn't want to harm you who just\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to help your cause how can we help\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 and he straight up looked and said\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing what can we do he said nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 but then a few years later or several\cb1 \
\cb3 years later when he came back from mecca\cb1 \
\cb3 he had moderated that stance malcolm x\cb1 \
\cb3 had moderated and said here's how\cb1 \
\cb3 non-blacks\cb1 \
\cb3 or whites can help us if\cb1 \
\cb3 malcolm x can change his stance\cb1 \
\cb3 black women maybe you can listen to the\cb1 \
\cb3 very white women\cb1 \
\cb3 who you fear are beating you taking the\cb1 \
\cb3 men you want\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever and here's the thing maybe it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not you\cb1 \
\cb3 i know you're fine you're beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a banging you're a 10 you're a\cb1 \
\cb3 phd i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 you got your dog and you live a good\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not talking about you in\cb1 \
\cb3 particular sis\cb1 \
\cb3 we talk about those other ones yeah not\cb1 \
\cb3 you but them other ones\cb1 \
\cb3 because what black women get real\cb1 \
\cb3 animated\cb1 \
\cb3 when a black man that they have seen\cb1 \
\cb3 had a shot at overlooked as soon as his\cb1 \
\cb3 paper's right and if he decided to give\cb1 \
\cb3 it a non-black woman all of a sudden\cb1 \
\cb3 these will be like\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 but can you hear him let's let's hear\cb1 \
\cb3 what the problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 coming from a white woman um\cb1 \
\cb3 can i just say something\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe it's a little bit of event but can\cb1 \
\cb3 i just say it\cb1 \
\cb3 um go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel inappropriate but um so\cb1 \
\cb3 as a white woman right as a caucasian\cb1 \
\cb3 woman um\cb1 \
\cb3 we tried to be so careful but um\cb1 \
\cb3 i have commented\cb1 \
\cb3 on you know i'm not pausing to start\cb1 \
\cb3 this talk\cb1 \
\cb3 let me tell you something kyla d why\cb1 \
\cb3 would a white woman want to help black\cb1 \
\cb3 men why would white women that want\cb1 \
\cb3 black men want to help black women\cb1 \
\cb3 see the problem is a lot of you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 like kyla d\cb1 \
\cb3 kayla d bad faith\cb1 \
\cb3 sit your mean ass down somewhere and\cb1 \
\cb3 shut up and listen\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of saying make it make sense hey\cb1 \
\cb3 you ain't win\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna be honest instead of\cb1 \
\cb3 questioning asking why somebody want to\cb1 \
\cb3 do it only question you need to ask\cb1 \
\cb3 the only question kayla d and women like\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to ask\cb1 \
\cb3 look at your left finger and see do you\cb1 \
\cb3 have a wedding ring from a valuable\cb1 \
\cb3 black man\cb1 \
\cb3 if not shut the french toast up you need\cb1 \
\cb3 all the help you can get\cb1 \
\cb3 rule number one if you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 stop digging\cb1 \
\cb3 see she can't tell you but i can tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't there's bad as you were losing\cb1 \
\cb3 today\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't get to question why somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 would want to help\cb1 \
\cb3 all you need to ask is all you need to\cb1 \
\cb3 do is say please and thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 just go ahead and speak go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 speak come on okay so i'm a part of a\cb1 \
\cb3 few groups right these like\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine groups these you know these\cb1 \
\cb3 facebook groups and\cb1 \
\cb3 um there's a lot of i noticed a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 african-american women in them\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's great but i get kicked out if\cb1 \
\cb3 i comment anything\cb1 \
\cb3 that is like of a negative nature that\cb1 \
\cb3 is to help\cb1 \
\cb3 to to me it's just in my opinion um\cb1 \
\cb3 my opinion could be bs you know okay but\cb1 \
\cb3 you can go here you well what's your\cb1 \
\cb3 question for me\cb1 \
\cb3 how to get along how to get how to get\cb1 \
\cb3 involved in black spaces\cb1 \
\cb3 notice what she said\cb1 \
\cb3 she would try to be as political as\cb1 \
\cb3 possible but the net net of it she said\cb1 \
\cb3 look\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm in these femininity groups these\cb1 \
\cb3 groups\cb1 \
\cb3 and when i make a comment as a white\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 no matter how i say it\cb1 \
\cb3 i get kicked out\cb1 \
\cb3 uh black women\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 why is it a problem again look at your\cb1 \
\cb3 left ring finger\cb1 \
\cb3 and is there a wedding is there an\cb1 \
\cb3 engagement ring from a valuable black\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 on it if not who are you to be kicking\cb1 \
\cb3 out any help\cb1 \
\cb3 and see that's one of the big problems\cb1 \
\cb3 that a lot of sisters have today\cb1 \
\cb3 you reject advice that can help you\cb1 \
\cb3 because you don't like the messenger or\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't like how the message was\cb1 \
\cb3 delivered\cb1 \
\cb3 how many times have i had women come\cb1 \
\cb3 onto this platform and say\cb1 \
\cb3 i i like what you're saying and but what\cb1 \
\cb3 you're saying is good but\cb1 \
\cb3 but can you you need to change it you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to\cb1 \
\cb3 do it like like umar johnson call us\cb1 \
\cb3 queens and\cb1 \
\cb3 this and that and i'm not gonna do it\cb1 \
\cb3 because um i ain't producing nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 no marriages no nothing no relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 no nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to be coddled and here's the\cb1 \
\cb3 thing the woman asked a legitimate\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 and she says when i try to offer\cb1 \
\cb3 advice that's helpful or beneficial\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm blocked but aren't these the same\cb1 \
\cb3 white women\cb1 \
\cb3 that you say are taking your high value\cb1 \
\cb3 black men\cb1 \
\cb3 so kyla d don't question why she's over\cb1 \
\cb3 there if she's over there to try to help\cb1 \
\cb3 because can she get what you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean how to even if i know online is\cb1 \
\cb3 very different than in real life but\cb1 \
\cb3 how to just coincide and just you know\cb1 \
\cb3 give it\cb1 \
\cb3 give my actual opinion i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 lie to any female okay give you a\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh uh uh let me just call you alex\cb1 \
\cb3 can i do that\cb1 \
\cb3 sure give your opinion to who men or\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 women i don't think men need my opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so so if i'm correct what you're asking\cb1 \
\cb3 is how can you\cb1 \
\cb3 give unsolicited\cb1 \
\cb3 advice to black women\cb1 \
\cb3 yes or just okay all right is that what\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on hold on chill out chill\cb1 \
\cb3 out chill out rude's the same for you um\cb1 \
\cb3 i just want to be clear what i'm hearing\cb1 \
\cb3 you say is going\cb1 \
\cb3 into groups which are public groups and\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to be able to give your\cb1 \
\cb3 input right\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 unsolicited\cb1 \
\cb3 advice across the board especially if it\cb1 \
\cb3 can be perceived as negative\cb1 \
\cb3 is often going to be met with uh\cb1 \
\cb3 backlash or conflict that's\cb1 \
\cb3 into the white women that's the truth\cb1 \
\cb3 whether you're giving good advice or not\cb1 \
\cb3 black women view you is not being it's\cb1 \
\cb3 unsolicited\cb1 \
\cb3 it's unsolicited so\cb1 \
\cb3 telling someone that's good for them\cb1 \
\cb3 selling someone something that's good\cb1 \
\cb3 for them\cb1 \
\cb3 that's unsolicited is often\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be met with negative\cb1 \
\cb3 that has nothing really that's\cb1 \
\cb3 irrespective of race but it is only\cb1 \
\cb3 magnified when you factor in race\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not gonna change\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's something that white women\cb1 \
\cb3 who are trying to help black women are\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna have to understand and something\cb1 \
\cb3 black women uh instead of\cb1 \
\cb3 asking her why is that is it helpful\cb1 \
\cb3 see this question of why she's here\cb1 \
\cb3 really should not matter if you're in a\cb1 \
\cb3 group\cb1 \
\cb3 and understand this woman from what i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand she was not in\cb1 \
\cb3 you know she was in femininity groups\cb1 \
\cb3 so there was nothing that said this is\cb1 \
\cb3 for black love or this that she was in\cb1 \
\cb3 femininity groups\cb1 \
\cb3 so if she's given advice on the subject\cb1 \
\cb3 of the group\cb1 \
\cb3 and you are needing help on the subject\cb1 \
\cb3 uh if you're losing because\cb1 \
\cb3 say what you want to and we can talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about her voice inflections and also the\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 but no one ever sits around and and\cb1 \
\cb3 when they when they cry for help when\cb1 \
\cb3 they go decide to go caring people run\cb1 \
\cb3 to them\cb1 \
\cb3 no one's running to help you because you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have the\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have the overt femininity that\cb1 \
\cb3 elicits those kind of responses you know\cb1 \
\cb3 it's true\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't come across like\cb1 \
\cb3 black women come across much harder\cb1 \
\cb3 so let's let it play\cb1 \
\cb3 regardless if you're white or not\cb1 \
\cb3 you understand i get i get backlash to i\cb1 \
\cb3 get backlash\cb1 \
\cb3 telling the truth to black women and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 but in this country are you from the\cb1 \
\cb3 united states\cb1 \
\cb3 yes so in this country you have to know\cb1 \
\cb3 that that's not going to change\cb1 \
\cb3 no matter how how well intended your\cb1 \
\cb3 advice may be\cb1 \
\cb3 because there's a 3100 people watching\cb1 \
\cb3 that many black women feel\cb1 \
\cb3 and they're right yeah they cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 if you guys want to do this topic uh\cb1 \
\cb3 we're going to need at least 10 more\cb1 \
\cb3 folks to drop 99 cents in there come on\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 are you kidding me\cb1 \
\cb3 really 3 000 people watching\cb1 \
\cb3 look no one's else talking about this\cb1 \
\cb3 and really\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know anybody else who could have\cb1 \
\cb3 this conversation and the call lines\cb1 \
\cb3 will be open\cb1 \
\cb3 uh white women you are welcome to call\cb1 \
\cb3 in non-black women this is your day to\cb1 \
\cb3 call in\cb1 \
\cb3 black women is your day to call in too\cb1 \
\cb3 today we start discussing this topic\cb1 \
\cb3 because if the ultimate point is to try\cb1 \
\cb3 to help black women get black men\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think many of you black women\cb1 \
\cb3 are in any position to be throwing away\cb1 \
\cb3 any advice regard\cb1 \
\cb3 regardless of whose is given by\cb1 \
\cb3 again look at your left ring finger and\cb1 \
\cb3 ask do i have an engagement ring or a\cb1 \
\cb3 wedding ring from a high value black man\cb1 \
\cb3 or a valuable black man\cb1 \
\cb3 if not you need all the help you can get\cb1 \
\cb3 if that's what you desire but uh we move\cb1 \
\cb3 forward\cb1 \
\cb3 uh when somebody decides to hit the\cb1 \
\cb3 super chat button\cb1 \
\cb3 nope shout out to rookie\cb1 \
\cb3 rachel thank you i mean come on guys\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a real serious topic i'm trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 make it as positive as as reasonable as\cb1 \
\cb3 possible\cb1 \
\cb3 but you're gonna have to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of black women you fear shout out\cb1 \
\cb3 to minister job minister jab\cb1 \
\cb3 has a series of videos saying the white\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 is god to black women\cb1 \
\cb3 go check his videos out before you get\cb1 \
\cb3 before you get upset go listen to what\cb1 \
\cb3 he's saying\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm sorry and especially here in the\cb1 \
\cb3 south\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you can talk all that stuff you want\cb1 \
\cb3 individually but\cb1 \
\cb3 who do you fear who's your competition\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 when it comes to black men who do you\cb1 \
\cb3 fear\cb1 \
\cb3 who's taking your high value men the\cb1 \
\cb3 rich men\cb1 \
\cb3 the men of means the 80 000\cb1 \
\cb3 the 75 000 a year plus brothers who's\cb1 \
\cb3 taking those\cb1 \
\cb3 men from you the six figure men\cb1 \
\cb3 who's taking them from you the seven\cb1 \
\cb3 figure dudes\cb1 \
\cb3 you ever had to come home\cb1 \
\cb3 can you accept that oh no it is not a\cb1 \
\cb3 burden but\cb1 \
\cb3 um can you accept the fact that they\cb1 \
\cb3 that there's a cultural component that\cb1 \
\cb3 they believe\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't accept or understand of course\cb1 \
\cb3 i will accept\cb1 \
\cb3 any opinion of another woman\cb1 \
\cb3 so well if that's the case if that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 case\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're coming in giving information\cb1 \
\cb3 in good faith\cb1 \
\cb3 then i have to ask this of you why does\cb1 \
\cb3 it why do you\cb1 \
\cb3 why does it bother you how they receive\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it does not bother me i think\cb1 \
\cb3 more so it i question it i just\cb1 \
\cb3 is my opinion that different you know if\cb1 \
\cb3 i put an avatar that was\cb1 \
\cb3 a cartoon you know now she made a good\cb1 \
\cb3 point\cb1 \
\cb3 she's like opinion doesn't necessarily\cb1 \
\cb3 bother me\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't necessarily believe that but she\cb1 \
\cb3 made a good point\cb1 \
\cb3 if i had an avatar that was a cartoon\cb1 \
\cb3 would what i'm saying be any less valid\cb1 \
\cb3 and to the answer to you no it wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 but the reality is\cb1 \
\cb3 culturally black folks are more\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional people\cb1 \
\cb3 and when a black woman sees a white\cb1 \
\cb3 woman giving advice\cb1 \
\cb3 there's going to be a highly especially\cb1 \
\cb3 unsolicited advice\cb1 \
\cb3 you shouldn't be surprised if you're met\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 suspicion\cb1 \
\cb3 but as i go on and progre progress in\cb1 \
\cb3 this conversation black women\cb1 \
\cb3 who's being hurt here she's getting\cb1 \
\cb3 blocked out of groups but who's losing\cb1 \
\cb3 this is about outcomes i don't care\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 how you feel about the subject of race\cb1 \
\cb3 or whatever it's about\cb1 \
\cb3 outcomes are you getting your best\cb1 \
\cb3 and brightest of black men 30\cb1 \
\cb3 of black men who have a bachelor's or\cb1 \
\cb3 higher\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out let me say that again\cb1 \
\cb3 30 percent of black men who marry\cb1 \
\cb3 and have a college degree bachelor's or\cb1 \
\cb3 higher\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out let me\cb1 \
\cb3 say it one more again\cb1 \
\cb3 of the black men who marry and have a\cb1 \
\cb3 bachelor's\cb1 \
\cb3 or higher 30 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 one two three out of ten choose a\cb1 \
\cb3 non-black\cb1 \
\cb3 woman to be their wife black women\cb1 \
\cb3 that is something you must understand\cb1 \
\cb3 and figure out it's not for\cb1 \
\cb3 and i've asked this question many times\cb1 \
\cb3 why are we why\cb1 \
\cb3 wh what are y'all wearing i've asked pro\cb1 \
\cb3 blacks and this other kind of stuff why\cb1 \
\cb3 are y'all willing to\cb1 \
\cb3 why don't y'all go ask these men i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 care what they do i don't care why they\cb1 \
\cb3 do what to do just go over there get\cb1 \
\cb3 your white woman and run over there\cb1 \
\cb3 that's stupid\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot no community can afford to\cb1 \
\cb3 have 30 percent of their talented people\cb1 \
\cb3 divesting moving out\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's completely asinine\cb1 \
\cb3 for anyone who says they care about\cb1 \
\cb3 black community or black family\cb1 \
\cb3 to not even be willing to ask the men\cb1 \
\cb3 hey man why'd you choose a non-black\cb1 \
\cb3 wife\cb1 \
\cb3 you know why and every time i've asked\cb1 \
\cb3 that question they've always thrown\cb1 \
\cb3 stones at the black man\cb1 \
\cb3 he's a sellout he's a [ __ ] he's this\cb1 \
\cb3 he's that and i i\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you're one of the people i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 talking to i think you're stupid\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're afraid to go ask that man\cb1 \
\cb3 a question because ultimately the\cb1 \
\cb3 question is going to point\cb1 \
\cb3 right back to why he chose not to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 someone that looked like him and it's\cb1 \
\cb3 easier\cb1 \
\cb3 to call him a [ __ ] than to deal with the\cb1 \
\cb3 fact\cb1 \
\cb3 that we need a better product\cb1 \
\cb3 if the product if one out if 30\cb1 \
\cb3 of the market is not buying the 30 of\cb1 \
\cb3 your best customer\cb1 \
\cb3 30 of your best potential customers are\cb1 \
\cb3 not buying your product\cb1 \
\cb3 no company would sit back and say we\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need that\cb1 \
\cb3 we'll we'll eat off of 70 and watch the\cb1 \
\cb3 trend\cb1 \
\cb3 growing it's a growing trend\cb1 \
\cb3 see the problem is many don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 ask the question\cb1 \
\cb3 because it leads back to your mama your\cb1 \
\cb3 auntie\cb1 \
\cb3 your big mama it leads back to women in\cb1 \
\cb3 your family\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you got people coming in women\cb1 \
\cb3 coming in\cb1 \
\cb3 saying hey i'm willing to help i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 willing to talk to you give you some\cb1 \
\cb3 advice and these\cb1 \
\cb3 femininity groups again these are\cb1 \
\cb3 women's groups\cb1 \
\cb3 not black women's groups or women's\cb1 \
\cb3 groups run by black women and you just\cb1 \
\cb3 block her out\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe because she knows something maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 because something that she's saying\cb1 \
\cb3 is something you were just completely\cb1 \
\cb3 unwilling to do shout out to nicole\cb1 \
\cb3 michelle when she asked women just to go\cb1 \
\cb3 around and smile at black men for a day\cb1 \
\cb3 and she got roasted by black women for\cb1 \
\cb3 simply asking women\cb1 \
\cb3 to just smile at every man you saw every\cb1 \
\cb3 brother you saw\cb1 \
\cb3 that's it just smile who didn't have a\cb1 \
\cb3 color\cb1 \
\cb3 um would they take it as you know\cb1 \
\cb3 different\cb1 \
\cb3 well then that's they haven't well yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is why i'm saying this is why\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm telling you that\cb1 \
\cb3 look um\cb1 \
\cb3 we got to acknowledge race in this\cb1 \
\cb3 country and there is something to be\cb1 \
\cb3 said for it\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you're asking if that it will be\cb1 \
\cb3 received differently if you had a\cb1 \
\cb3 picture an avatar of a black hole\cb1 \
\cb3 versus a white woman the answer is more\cb1 \
\cb3 likely yes\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know that um but that's why i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're going to give unsolicited\cb1 \
\cb3 opinions\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're doing it in good faith then\cb1 \
\cb3 be happy that the information you gave\cb1 \
\cb3 was good\cb1 \
\cb3 but it sounds as though you want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 accepted\cb1 \
\cb3 or you want your information to be\cb1 \
\cb3 approved of as if\cb1 \
\cb3 race did not matter\cb1 \
\cb3 um i don't think it's about being\cb1 \
\cb3 accepted\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's about just what i want a\cb1 \
\cb3 perspective\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's just asking why\cb1 \
\cb3 like why is it why what give me an\cb1 \
\cb3 example because\cb1 \
\cb3 dj pope i just copy the comment and i\cb1 \
\cb3 want you guys to answer the question\cb1 \
\cb3 dj pope writes\cb1 \
\cb3 and answer the question easy bws are\cb1 \
\cb3 jealous and feel inferior\cb1 \
\cb3 to wwe is there any truth to that\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies is there any truth to what he's\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe not you specifically\cb1 \
\cb3 but why reject information\cb1 \
\cb3 from someone you perceive is winning\cb1 \
\cb3 why reject the information outright\cb1 \
\cb3 truthfully you're giving me what do you\cb1 \
\cb3 give me an example of something that\cb1 \
\cb3 happened\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so for example there's this photo\cb1 \
\cb3 this you know this girl she posted in\cb1 \
\cb3 this femininity group or like this like\cb1 \
\cb3 classic group\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was her you know doing this\cb1 \
\cb3 inappropriate pose like this kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know butt out pose all right she was\cb1 \
\cb3 a little she's a little overweight so it\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't even look appropriate so it's\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 it looked a little bit it just looked\cb1 \
\cb3 inappropriate it didn't look like he\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 so i said and a ton of other girls said\cb1 \
\cb3 it too\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what sucks um i was like you know\cb1 \
\cb3 this looks you know i i said it may be a\cb1 \
\cb3 longer dress\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know not so form-fitting uh you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 cinch at the waist you know the lower\cb1 \
\cb3 grass and then the different pose would\cb1 \
\cb3 be\cb1 \
\cb3 you know a little bit more appropriate\cb1 \
\cb3 and i got blocked from the group\cb1 \
\cb3 whereas and i read a lot of their\cb1 \
\cb3 comments and it was like you know mixed\cb1 \
\cb3 race and\cb1 \
\cb3 you know african-american right so so\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so if i'm hearing you you shared an\cb1 \
\cb3 opinion that was\cb1 \
\cb3 seemingly shared by black women in the\cb1 \
\cb3 group\cb1 \
\cb3 but by you saying something that you\cb1 \
\cb3 perceive to be\cb1 \
\cb3 right in line with what they said you\cb1 \
\cb3 got immediately blocked\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so it's like why do i say anything\cb1 \
\cb3 at all\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody in the chat room knock off\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about uh kamala harris\cb1 \
\cb3 enough enough\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want to see any more comments\cb1 \
\cb3 about kamala harris\cb1 \
\cb3 get on the subject please find someone\cb1 \
\cb3 else to talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 and if i have to go in and flag the word\cb1 \
\cb3 kamala\cb1 \
\cb3 and you continue to talk about her\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna be putting time out\cb1 \
\cb3 if you insist on continuing i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 block you i want my chat to be\cb1 \
\cb3 discussing something that's off the\cb1 \
\cb3 subject respect the chat room folks\cb1 \
\cb3 thanks you know like i just observe and\cb1 \
\cb3 laugh right like what was what i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 what does caucasian women do who want to\cb1 \
\cb3 help out like\cb1 \
\cb3 well here's here's the thing if you\cb1 \
\cb3 really out\cb1 \
\cb3 she said what does caucasian women do\cb1 \
\cb3 who want to help out\cb1 \
\cb3 kyla d the first thing you don't do is\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 why again if you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 if winning is defined is being married\cb1 \
\cb3 to a black man of value\cb1 \
\cb3 and you cannot get that done\cb1 \
\cb3 and and women like and and if and if\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the norm\cb1 \
\cb3 that's defined as not winning which is\cb1 \
\cb3 losing\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't question the person you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 get the question why do you want to help\cb1 \
\cb3 the first thing to say is can this help\cb1 \
\cb3 me win\cb1 \
\cb3 when first question later\cb1 \
\cb3 especially when the advice is coming\cb1 \
\cb3 from someone you perceive is winning\cb1 \
\cb3 answer the question um you go away\cb1 \
\cb3 if you truly want to help out you go\cb1 \
\cb3 where you can be here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 the the question automatically becomes\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you helping here that's really\cb1 \
\cb3 they wonder why you're there\cb1 \
\cb3 no oh my gosh i'm not trying to help out\cb1 \
\cb3 i just stopped typing in all caps\cb1 \
\cb3 on facebook just to join them i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm saying listen to what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying i hear you\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are but but as a white woman\cb1 \
\cb3 going into a predominantly black group\cb1 \
\cb3 you're out you're you have to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in the minority\cb1 \
\cb3 why that's the question black women are\cb1 \
\cb3 looking at you and saying why are you\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 and have you ever answered why you're\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 no and i acknowledge the fact that she\cb1 \
\cb3 is naive\cb1 \
\cb3 to think she can just come into a group\cb1 \
\cb3 start saying stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 without anybody knowing uh\cb1 \
\cb3 but again\cb1 \
\cb3 that's on her if you're not winning\cb1 \
\cb3 who are you to be throwing out any\cb1 \
\cb3 advice\cb1 \
\cb3 can what she's saying and what these\cb1 \
\cb3 women are saying and what any other\cb1 \
\cb3 group of women\cb1 \
\cb3 who is who are successfully marrying\cb1 \
\cb3 mating and coupling with their men\cb1 \
\cb3 you're really not in a position to be\cb1 \
\cb3 throwing any advice away when 26\cb1 \
\cb3 of you will marry in your lifetime\cb1 \
\cb3 so as irritating as you may say her\cb1 \
\cb3 voice is\cb1 \
\cb3 and her naive or whatever like it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 52 percent of white women or 51 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 of white women can look can\cb1 \
\cb3 can be married in their lifetime\cb1 \
\cb3 again i knew this subject was on trigger\cb1 \
\cb3 and i don't care\cb1 \
\cb3 what most y'all are talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're talking about stuff that\cb1 \
\cb3 does not matter\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's another thing black but we\cb1 \
\cb3 got to get past this emotionality\cb1 \
\cb3 emotionality making you make stupid\cb1 \
\cb3 decisions\cb1 \
\cb3 you know well then that's a problem and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to understand something that's\cb1 \
\cb3 a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 it doesn't matter how listen breathe it\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't matter how good your intentions\cb1 \
\cb3 are\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to answer why you're there\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're looked at with suspicion\cb1 \
\cb3 which is true um it's not weird it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 weird and see that's what i mean that's\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm trying to tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a race component and a cultural\cb1 \
\cb3 component that you find\cb1 \
\cb3 weird because you're not black and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 telling you\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to accept it this\cb1 \
\cb3 i told her she had to accept it because\cb1 \
\cb3 her desire was to help\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but here's the thing black women\cb1 \
\cb3 just like you think black men have to\cb1 \
\cb3 accept you the way you are\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 no they don't and\cb1 \
\cb3 and and and something that has never\cb1 \
\cb3 happened before\cb1 \
\cb3 men are woken up in masses and say i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't i'd rather have nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 so now you're having to deal with the\cb1 \
\cb3 fact that brothers ain't just accepting\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 overweight uncooperative with other\cb1 \
\cb3 men's children if that applies to you\cb1 \
\cb3 they're saying i'd rather have nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 becky myleen marisol\cb1 \
\cb3 and anu are seeing that you don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 your high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 your college-educated men your lames\cb1 \
\cb3 your squares your college your goofies\cb1 \
\cb3 and all that\cb1 \
\cb3 they're seeing that you don't want them\cb1 \
\cb3 and they're running to get those uh\cb1 \
\cb3 guys who can code those stem guys the\cb1 \
\cb3 engineers they're running to get them\cb1 \
\cb3 picking up and saying oh thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you thank you thank you they're\cb1 \
\cb3 picking them up\cb1 \
\cb3 like this and the person and who's\cb1 \
\cb3 losing\cb1 \
\cb3 so while it may be for that particular\cb1 \
\cb3 woman because she continues to care\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't expect these people to come over\cb1 \
\cb3 here and have to fight you to help you\cb1 \
\cb3 if they're offering help and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 stupid enough to block them\cb1 \
\cb3 and back up not stupid if they're\cb1 \
\cb3 offering help\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're foolish enough to block them\cb1 \
\cb3 turn them down give them the read them\cb1 \
\cb3 the riot act\cb1 \
\cb3 before you allow them to help that's\cb1 \
\cb3 foolish on your part a case in point\cb1 \
\cb3 a man is a man is out on his boat\cb1 \
\cb3 fishing and this a man is out on his\cb1 \
\cb3 boat\cb1 \
\cb3 fishing storm comes up and he's capsized\cb1 \
\cb3 he's floating out in the ocean\cb1 \
\cb3 he's got a life preserver on\cb1 \
\cb3 ship comes by oh man you need some help\cb1 \
\cb3 no thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 god will save me next thing you know\cb1 \
\cb3 bigger boat comes along\cb1 \
\cb3 oh man storm is heavy you need some help\cb1 \
\cb3 no thank you god will save me okay\cb1 \
\cb3 a few hours later an even bigger boat\cb1 \
\cb3 comes along hey man\cb1 \
\cb3 you should bother storm you need some\cb1 \
\cb3 help no no no thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 god will save me and\cb1 \
\cb3 then eventually he tires and he drowns\cb1 \
\cb3 and he was one storming up to god he\cb1 \
\cb3 said god\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe you i prayed to you my heart\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm your servant why didn't you\cb1 \
\cb3 save me\cb1 \
\cb3 and god looks up and said i sent you\cb1 \
\cb3 three boats you dummy\cb1 \
\cb3 that story is this\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't get to choose where the help\cb1 \
\cb3 comes from\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're drowning when you're dying\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're in a carry a precarious\cb1 \
\cb3 position when people are asking\cb1 \
\cb3 are you agents of chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're being equated to german\cb1 \
\cb3 shepherds\cb1 \
\cb3 what when are you ladies going to start\cb1 \
\cb3 to realize that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd does not matter\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not in a position if if the\cb1 \
\cb3 if winning means husband\cb1 \
\cb3 and someone to spend your life with\cb1 \
\cb3 26 percent is not a good average\cb1 \
\cb3 this is what it is so case in point when\cb1 \
\cb3 i go\cb1 \
\cb3 to the shanghainese association if i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't show up with\cb1 \
\cb3 master lee my sound to cordero people\cb1 \
\cb3 are automatically wondering\cb1 \
\cb3 what is this black man doing over here\cb1 \
\cb3 with these shanghainese people\cb1 \
\cb3 who speak cantonese and you don't speak\cb1 \
\cb3 anything they look at me as you're an\cb1 \
\cb3 outsider you don't belong here it\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't matter that i know the customs\cb1 \
\cb3 understand the culture and and whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 let me say something else to the women\cb1 \
\cb3 like tracy and i kind of see the fact\cb1 \
\cb3 that you're starting to split hairs\cb1 \
\cb3 good me who's a good man the fact that\cb1 \
\cb3 you are the fact that\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact that you have the nerve to\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 the non-black women the black men\cb1 \
\cb3 everyone\cb1 \
\cb3 else but the woman in the mirror shows\cb1 \
\cb3 the level of disconnect that far too\cb1 \
\cb3 many of you have\cb1 \
\cb3 questioning whether or not a man is good\cb1 \
\cb3 at that again all i care about\cb1 \
\cb3 is i see the same names in this chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room\cb1 \
\cb3 night in night out who stand and have\cb1 \
\cb3 some of those\cb1 \
\cb3 womanist feminists losing views\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're not winning you're here every\cb1 \
\cb3 night because you don't have a man\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have a family and you are too\cb1 \
\cb3 proud to stop fighting you're too proud\cb1 \
\cb3 to admit you're losing and don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 how to win\cb1 \
\cb3 and you look foolish saying the same\cb1 \
\cb3 schnit\cb1 \
\cb3 every night when everybody can see that\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 two glasses of wine into it ready to\cb1 \
\cb3 grab an\cb1 \
\cb3 ambien to knock yourself out because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in the middle of the holiday\cb1 \
\cb3 cuffing season\cb1 \
\cb3 a freaking loan\cb1 \
\cb3 so you can sit in there and type in the\cb1 \
\cb3 chat room and question the me and\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 question of black men question all these\cb1 \
\cb3 other women question everybody else why\cb1 \
\cb3 are you sitting\cb1 \
\cb3 in the danger zone but at the end of the\cb1 \
\cb3 day\cb1 \
\cb3 now when you look under that christmas\cb1 \
\cb3 tree\cb1 \
\cb3 shows up and says he's my seeing my\cb1 \
\cb3 student is automatically oh okay\cb1 \
\cb3 we can trust you they don't trust you\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't know you and if you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be accepted if you want to give your\cb1 \
\cb3 opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 that is going to be there\cb1 \
\cb3 okay no i'm really like not hurt um\cb1 \
\cb3 i was just asking in a very genuine\cb1 \
\cb3 manner just because\cb1 \
\cb3 i gave i think i gave you an answer in\cb1 \
\cb3 there in a reasonable manner\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am it would be no different than if\cb1 \
\cb3 you or any other\cb1 \
\cb3 uh any other white woman when they in a\cb1 \
\cb3 black group giving what they considered\cb1 \
\cb3 unsolicited advice\cb1 \
\cb3 see here's the thing alex no one you you\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 you joined um voluntarily no one asked\cb1 \
\cb3 you to join the group right\cb1 \
\cb3 right not this particular one right so\cb1 \
\cb3 so it would be different if they had\cb1 \
\cb3 asked you to join\cb1 \
\cb3 um did you go to college\cb1 \
\cb3 i did did you pledge a sorority\cb1 \
\cb3 i did not okay um on my\cb1 \
\cb3 on my campus oh you 70\cb1 \
\cb3 of those students oh let me let me read\cb1 \
\cb3 this big shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 black women should listen to women who\cb1 \
\cb3 have the lives they desire not just some\cb1 \
\cb3 random opinionated white woman with\cb1 \
\cb3 their self-worth\cb1 \
\cb3 hey big shirley dennis hey big shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 i guarantee you wouldn't want to go out\cb1 \
\cb3 with that white woman and try to see\cb1 \
\cb3 what black men decide\cb1 \
\cb3 if he wanted her or you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm tell you right now big shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 you can talk all that [ __ ] that you want\cb1 \
\cb3 to in there because your avatar doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 have your picture\cb1 \
\cb3 but many women like you fear them fear\cb1 \
\cb3 white women\cb1 \
\cb3 because you fear that you cannot measure\cb1 \
\cb3 up\cb1 \
\cb3 and you talk all this bravado all this\cb1 \
\cb3 foolishness\cb1 \
\cb3 when at the end of the day you are by\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 and unfit for the kind of men you say\cb1 \
\cb3 you want\cb1 \
\cb3 so you saying they should listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 women whose life they desire one out of\cb1 \
\cb3 four black women will ever get married\cb1 \
\cb3 big shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 you sound like a fool\cb1 \
\cb3 but of course all it takes to trigger a\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman is to show a white woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and you will show your natural behind\cb1 \
\cb3 so everybody applause to big shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 and big shirley make sure you jump your\cb1 \
\cb3 big ass on a\cb1 \
\cb3 zoom call put it on widescreen though to\cb1 \
\cb3 make sure you got enough room to get on\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 sometimes some sort of fraternity or\cb1 \
\cb3 sorority but there's a big difference\cb1 \
\cb3 between a traditionally\cb1 \
\cb3 black fraternity or sorority than a\cb1 \
\cb3 traditionally white paternity sorority\cb1 \
\cb3 um if you as a white woman\cb1 \
\cb3 went to pledge a black sorority you\cb1 \
\cb3 would get questions differently was big\cb1 \
\cb3 charlotte big shirley in the comment\cb1 \
\cb3 section white sorority\cb1 \
\cb3 and what i'm telling you is in this\cb1 \
\cb3 country\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to have to no matter how\cb1 \
\cb3 good your intentions are you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 have to\cb1 \
\cb3 familiarize yourself with race if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to cross racial lines\cb1 \
\cb3 case so that's enough of that because\cb1 \
\cb3 i've said what i have to say\cb1 \
\cb3 i told that woman look you're gonna have\cb1 \
\cb3 to understand where it's coming from but\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what she don't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 she'll have to understand stuff she\cb1 \
\cb3 don't understand anything because at the\cb1 \
\cb3 end of the day\cb1 \
\cb3 that woman was trying to help a group of\cb1 \
\cb3 women who don't want her help\cb1 \
\cb3 well okay whose help do you want you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want black men you don't care\cb1 \
\cb3 about what black men say so you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want our opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't you you think that all you\cb1 \
\cb3 think that when a black man gets\cb1 \
\cb3 gets on and gets old up there he's gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 go get a white woman\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of saying then why whose help do\cb1 \
\cb3 you want big shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 because what you doing ain't working\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd big shirley it ain't working\cb1 \
\cb3 26 ain't working\cb1 \
\cb3 average weight 187 pounds\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't working and no matter\cb1 \
\cb3 how i say it you still gonna get women\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 big shirley saying whatever whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll do what i want that's what you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 what big [ __ ] that's that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what they comment why we gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to this instead of some\cb1 \
\cb3 opinionated\cb1 \
\cb3 sort of opinionated white woman without\cb1 \
\cb3 awareness whatever i'll do what i want\cb1 \
\cb3 opinionated\cb1 \
\cb3 who's known for being opinionated big\cb1 \
\cb3 shirley is it them of you\cb1 \
\cb3 i swear to god danger zone\cb1 \
\cb3 and i know why it's bothering so many\cb1 \
\cb3 because this is where you are 27 to 35\cb1 \
\cb3 and what motivates most of you is fear\cb1 \
\cb3 fear that you are unfit\cb1 \
\cb3 to ever be with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 long term\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why you want to reject reject\cb1 \
\cb3 opinions from anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 that have been shown to work\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to reject everything that looks\cb1 \
\cb3 like a fact\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to reject everything that can\cb1 \
\cb3 be proven with observable reality\cb1 \
\cb3 because at the end of the day because it\cb1 \
\cb3 makes you have to stand and be\cb1 \
\cb3 accountable\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know as big as your ass is you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to stand up that long you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't stand up that long\cb1 \
\cb3 and you can't be in a relationship that\cb1 \
\cb3 long because if all the responsibility's\cb1 \
\cb3 been told\cb1 \
\cb3 that it's not your fault it's not this\cb1 \
\cb3 is not that now everybody sit back\cb1 \
\cb3 saying well what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 let's help you out let's let's get you\cb1 \
\cb3 some advice let's let's help you\cb1 \
\cb3 let's let's identify what it is you say\cb1 \
\cb3 you want all right\cb1 \
\cb3 you want this you want that you want\cb1 \
\cb3 this you want that it needs to be this\cb1 \
\cb3 way you need okay great\cb1 \
\cb3 and if we found that with the man that\cb1 \
\cb3 you want would he want you\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm trying to acting like it doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 exist\cb1 \
\cb3 it's blood sport when it comes out here\cb1 \
\cb3 to mating and dating in relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 and in la\cb1 \
\cb3 it's wide open out in the streets of l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 i see black men\cb1 \
\cb3 uh seeing a lot of brothers with\cb1 \
\cb3 non-black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and it is time we openly start talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about it\cb1 \
\cb3 because you cannot sit around and be as\cb1 \
\cb3 oblivious\cb1 \
\cb3 entitled combative difficult\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 losing mean one out of four of you will\cb1 \
\cb3 marry a man that looks like you\cb1 \
\cb3 in your lifetime\cb1 \
\cb3 well one out of four black women will\cb1 \
\cb3 expect to be married yeah that's it\cb1 \

\cb3 all right here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 unmute yourself hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hello how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i'm good what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 i i thought i had i thought i could\cb1 \
\cb3 bring you know some um\cb1 \
\cb3 that side of the story yeah so um\cb1 \
\cb3 i became a cna when i was 17 and so i\cb1 \
\cb3 worked with a lot of older\cb1 \
\cb3 not older but 30s married white women\cb1 \
\cb3 and in my experience as a black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 they gave me\cb1 \
\cb3 terrible advice\cb1 \
\cb3 the white women the married white women\cb1 \
\cb3 they were telling me they gave you\cb1 \
\cb3 terrible advice\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah they were telling me to essentially\cb1 \
\cb3 be promiscuous\cb1 \
\cb3 um not to worry about long-term\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah like pretty much hot girl summer\cb1 \
\cb3 for as long as i can that's what they\cb1 \
\cb3 were advocating for me\cb1 \
\cb3 the only person that was advocating for\cb1 \
\cb3 me to actually pursue long-term\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships were um\cb1 \
\cb3 was the indian woman i worked with she\cb1 \
\cb3 was saying literally everything\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i'm going now you know i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to question the stuff you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying because\cb1 \
\cb3 this may be your experience but yeah yes\cb1 \
\cb3 of course\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i don't know what the norm is but\cb1 \
\cb3 that's my experience\cb1 \
\cb3 um and a part of me wondered if\cb1 \
\cb3 it's because okay let's just ask\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself a question okay\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah let's just assume your anecdotal\cb1 \
\cb3 experience is what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 who has the most what group of women is\cb1 \
\cb3 the most married in this country\cb1 \
\cb3 asian who's second\cb1 \
\cb3 white latino\cb1 \
\cb3 who's last black women\cb1 \
\cb3 so if your anecdotal experience if you\cb1 \
\cb3 had 10 women telling you to be\cb1 \
\cb3 hot girl summer it up um\cb1 \
\cb3 you can understand how i can look at\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're saying and say\cb1 \
\cb3 and what no i understand\cb1 \
\cb3 um i just wanted to uh bring that side\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's not that side it's your\cb1 \
\cb3 anecdotal experience\cb1 \
\cb3 see what you black women often do\cb1 \
\cb3 is when someone like myself comes in and\cb1 \
\cb3 quotes stats facts and statistics\cb1 \
\cb3 figures\cb1 \
\cb3 you come in and say yeah but i but what\cb1 \
\cb3 i know is different\cb1 \
\cb3 does what you have to say how old are\cb1 \
\cb3 you by the way\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 22. exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly 22 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 with no real life experience in a s and\cb1 \
\cb3 a\cb1 \
\cb3 handful of women who told you something\cb1 \
\cb3 you would do better\cb1 \
\cb3 sitting down and listening other than\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to say well let me give you a\cb1 \
\cb3 different point of view\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not in a position for that at 22.\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not trying to go against this yes\cb1 \
\cb3 you are yes you are\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm trying to and so you're still\cb1 \
\cb3 talking in the back then and\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly and i'm being and i mean no\cb1 \
\cb3 disrespect but you need to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact that you're 22\cb1 \
\cb3 you really should be listening i'm 51\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 22\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not my equal we're not peers\cb1 \
\cb3 we have where's your father\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 jamie casey whatever you want to call\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 you y'all don't have to realize it is a\cb1 \
\cb3 new day out here\cb1 \
\cb3 just because well it's not been my\cb1 \
\cb3 experience you don't know anything\cb1 \
\cb3 you wanna you really wanna get to the\cb1 \
\cb3 car ask where your father is or does\cb1 \
\cb3 your husband have to think about that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what happened\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my god actual male authority\cb1 \
\cb3 shut your ass down somewhere\cb1 \
\cb3 so money world\cb1 \
\cb3 big shirley i know big shirley she gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 be mad at me\cb1 \
\cb3 picture they're gonna have a video\cb1 \
\cb3 tomorrow\cb1 \
\cb3 look\cb1 \
\cb3 i need to say something you young black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 you show how little you have how little\cb1 \
\cb3 respect you have\cb1 \
\cb3 for the black male image the fact that\cb1 \
\cb3 you are so\cb1 \
\cb3 young thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 that you that your very small\cb1 \
\cb3 lived experience matters\cb1 \
\cb3 to the global conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 i would just imagine if i was an indian\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 at 51 years old i would i wonder how\cb1 \
\cb3 many\cb1 \
\cb3 23 or under indian women would actually\cb1 \
\cb3 call in to\cb1 \
\cb3 position themselves and this is part of\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem because you just\cb1 \
\cb3 simply don't have any respect for black\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 and other groups of men see this\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to have to connect like\cb1 \

\cb3 military child\cb1 \
\cb3 and even though my mother was a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 she because i was the oldest and i was\cb1 \
\cb3 the only girl\cb1 \
\cb3 she taught me as the oldest girl um you\cb1 \
\cb3 know that i had to be\cb1 \
\cb3 independent um you know men with money\cb1 \
\cb3 they're either going to control you\cb1 \
\cb3 or they're going to try to wait try to\cb1 \
\cb3 find a way to abuse you in a way\cb1 \
\cb3 so you wanna be strong and stand on your\cb1 \
\cb3 own\cb1 \
\cb3 and um you know and i used to you know i\cb1 \
\cb3 used to believe it i'm just like okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i'm gonna go out here i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 you know find me a great job i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 you know be\cb1 \
\cb3 independent and really just like you\cb1 \
\cb3 know work work and really\cb1 \
\cb3 not depend on anybody but the more\cb1 \
\cb3 i did that and follow those leads i\cb1 \
\cb3 failed in a lot of my relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 and and i will have to have internet let\cb1 \
\cb3 me ask you let me ask you a question\cb1 \
\cb3 you said your mother said that men with\cb1 \
\cb3 money would try to\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 abuse you she had a fear she said that\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know she was just like\cb1 \
\cb3 that was a fear of her she was just like\cb1 \
\cb3 you you want to be careful because\cb1 \
\cb3 most men with money they are they try to\cb1 \
\cb3 use that to\cb1 \
\cb3 control women or they will use that i\cb1 \
\cb3 got to ask you does your mother ever\cb1 \
\cb3 date men with\cb1 \
\cb3 money well that's the crazy thing so\cb1 \
\cb3 my mom married my dad young they had me\cb1 \
\cb3 and they got married so my dad always\cb1 \
\cb3 took care of my mama\cb1 \
\cb3 my mama never had to work or anything\cb1 \
\cb3 like that\cb1 \
\cb3 um and the point the point the point i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 making the point i'm making\cb1 \
\cb3 is she was telling you something that\cb1 \
\cb3 she never experienced\cb1 \
\cb3 yes yes and all she did was and all you\cb1 \
\cb3 do is make your daughters\cb1 \
\cb3 fearful of successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and and and that's what it was and\cb1 \
\cb3 it was crazy because out of all of her\cb1 \
\cb3 sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 she was the only one that was like\cb1 \
\cb3 really married and success like my dad\cb1 \
\cb3 gave her\cb1 \
\cb3 a beautiful lifestyle but when i was\cb1 \
\cb3 when we were around her sisters and\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff like that\cb1 \
\cb3 i always heard nick like a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 negative stuff around\cb1 \
\cb3 men so being being in the middle\cb1 \
\cb3 she has four sisters that she's she's\cb1 \
\cb3 from uh child of seven\cb1 \
\cb3 she has four sisters three three dudes\cb1 \
\cb3 three boys\cb1 \
\cb3 right brothers i'm sorry so um\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're going you know in the\cb1 \
\cb3 military you're around a lot of diver\cb1 \
\cb3 diversity you see other things so\cb1 \
\cb3 growing\cb1 \
\cb3 so how do you i'm 25. so how's it\cb1 \
\cb3 so when's your last relationship so i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 actually\cb1 \
\cb3 dating a high valued man right now\cb1 \
\cb3 okay okay and how long have you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 been dating\cb1 \
\cb3 uh we've been dating for a couple of\cb1 \
\cb3 months it's still new it's still fresh\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but your previous relationship was\cb1 \
\cb3 how long\cb1 \
\cb3 uh my previous relationship was three\cb1 \
\cb3 years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 i i really reflected and worked on\cb1 \
\cb3 myself before now i did date\cb1 \
\cb3 i definitely dated but i knew that i was\cb1 \
\cb3 looking for a man\cb1 \
\cb3 i i knew what i wanted and i didn't want\cb1 \
\cb3 to settle on what i used to settle for\cb1 \
\cb3 destiny i got i got to get to some other\cb1 \
\cb3 callers gonna hold you in here but\cb1 \
\cb3 here's\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing i would say oftentimes\cb1 \
\cb3 see your mother won your mother\cb1 \
\cb3 but listen listen i'm about to say\cb1 \
\cb3 listen please your mother won\cb1 \
\cb3 but your sisters did but her sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't and my mother\cb1 \
\cb3 used to win in her relationships and her\cb1 \
\cb3 sisters never did\cb1 \
\cb3 so your mother often probably was trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to tell you what she thought was going\cb1 \
\cb3 to help you\cb1 \
\cb3 she felt guilty that she won uh\cb1 \
\cb3 and her other sisters didn't that's\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a lot of stuff going on kevin i\cb1 \
\cb3 think so but just a second this is\cb1 \
\cb3 just a second okay don't repeat\cb1 \
\cb3 your mother can't help you i know that's\cb1 \
\cb3 all i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 i know because growing up i i used to\cb1 \
\cb3 mirror\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of mannerisms from other like\cb1 \
\cb3 like the white girls like anybody any\cb1 \
\cb3 any girl\cb1 \
\cb3 that i felt like especially like a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of chilies and stuff because i i really\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 a girly girl at first growing up and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to tell you that\cb1 \
\cb3 even if you've been with this guy for\cb1 \
\cb3 two months okay\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah you're still chomping at the bit to\cb1 \
\cb3 jump in\cb1 \
\cb3 well okay kevin i understand i need you\cb1 \
\cb3 i need\cb1 \
\cb3 okay oh well no it can't because i\cb1 \
\cb3 haven't even said it\cb1 \
\cb3 okay okay tell me what i was gonna say\cb1 \
\cb3 well i i think you're you're trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 say that because of the things that she\cb1 \
\cb3 was\cb1 \
\cb3 she has been training me i'm still i\cb1 \
\cb3 still fully don't understand\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of how to keep it in a sense i may\cb1 \
\cb3 mess this up or i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no see what you just did is\cb1 \
\cb3 you assume that you know what i was\cb1 \
\cb3 going to say and that you determined\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 well i already know so it's not even\cb1 \
\cb3 important you're 100 wrong that's not\cb1 \
\cb3 what i was going to say\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well i apologize go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's going to cause you\cb1 \
\cb3 problems in relationships with men of\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to learn to slow down\cb1 \
\cb3 and you don't have to match my energy\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 cosign the things i'm saying you have to\cb1 \
\cb3 play the feminine role\cb1 \
\cb3 yes playing a masculine role\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why how long ago was your last\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship three years ago you worked\cb1 \
\cb3 on yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 still need more work because if you\cb1 \
\cb3 haven't been going for two months\cb1 \
\cb3 you will end up blowing it with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 you are so eager\cb1 \
\cb3 to be right\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is one of the things on my\cb1 \
\cb3 channel i talk about the\cb1 \
\cb3 uh pathology of a lot of our sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 shame\cb1 \
\cb3 insults guilt and the need to be right\cb1 \
\cb3 and many of you don't realize that your\cb1 \
\cb3 need to be right\cb1 \
\cb3 makes you difficult to talk to even when\cb1 \
\cb3 your intentions are good\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't sense that your intentions are\cb1 \
\cb3 bad i just think that you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to learn how to listen\cb1 \
\cb3 well kevin i i have been working on that\cb1 \
\cb3 because that has been problems\cb1 \
\cb3 in my other relationships and i do watch\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of your videos as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and when you talk i do listen and i do\cb1 \
\cb3 self-reflect a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 and i am working on oh i've yeah i've\cb1 \
\cb3 done therapy already\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm still currently in therapy um i\cb1 \
\cb3 move from\cb1 \
\cb3 uh not a therapist but i also do a life\cb1 \
\cb3 coach now i move to a life coach\cb1 \
\cb3 all right well communication is\cb1 \
\cb3 important in a relationship and learning\cb1 \
\cb3 how to communicate from your feminine\cb1 \
\cb3 energy\cb1 \
\cb3 would be better because they're still\cb1 \
\cb3 whether it's your intentions or not\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot overcome all that\cb1 \
\cb3 programming in just a short time i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to have mutual get to the next\cb1 \
\cb3 caller\cb1 \
\cb3 kanika okay yeah that's why i say guys\cb1 \
\cb3 women are women kanika i'm mute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 hello yeah what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 okay black women can learn from white\cb1 \
\cb3 women in terms of a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 by the way i didn't ask how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 40.\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um have you okay\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead that's simply it um\cb1 \
\cb3 so i say that i guess i say that because\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i have been watching you as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and i take a lot of your content um\cb1 \
\cb3 to my personal uh group of people or\cb1 \
\cb3 what have you\cb1 \
\cb3 and some of those questions i posed to\cb1 \
\cb3 the women\cb1 \
\cb3 in particular like what is the benefit\cb1 \
\cb3 of a modern wife\cb1 \
\cb3 and a lot of my black friends came to\cb1 \
\cb3 answer that question\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's in the way that i did not think\cb1 \
\cb3 that they should have\cb1 \
\cb3 um but the white girls they came on and\cb1 \
\cb3 answered it\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly the way they should um in the\cb1 \
\cb3 sense that you know they value\cb1 \
\cb3 um being a wife and being dismissive\cb1 \
\cb3 and being submissive to their husband\cb1 \
\cb3 over money\cb1 \
\cb3 and a career hmm um\cb1 \
\cb3 now okay\cb1 \
\cb3 well and it's sad because that means a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot of us end up being by ourselves\cb1 \
\cb3 have you ever been married yes i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 actually divorced 12 years married\cb1 \
\cb3 divorced\cb1 \
\cb3 two years okay oh okay do you uh\cb1 \
\cb3 want a relationship at some point in the\cb1 \
\cb3 future um\cb1 \
\cb3 at this point i want a partner yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i said relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 yes yes i do okay\cb1 \
\cb3 well you know awareness is where it\cb1 \
\cb3 starts with a lot of people around our\cb1 \
\cb3 age because\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel sorry for our generation x we\cb1 \
\cb3 were all lied to\cb1 \
\cb3 the women were lying to the men were\cb1 \
\cb3 lied to but we can't continue to act as\cb1 \
\cb3 though we don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 better because well it don't work what\cb1 \
\cb3 we did didn't work\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly and i get a lot of pushback from\cb1 \
\cb3 um the women in our generation because\cb1 \
\cb3 of how i speak and\cb1 \
\cb3 um i try to make them realize you're mad\cb1 \
\cb3 at the\cb1 \
\cb3 black man because because he's going to\cb1 \
\cb3 the white woman but what are you doing\cb1 \
\cb3 like maybe you can learn something from\cb1 \
\cb3 her and it doesn't mean that we're weak\cb1 \
\cb3 or we devalue ourselves because we're\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 not at all if anything that makes this\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah um\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm in hotel six yeah just drop it up\cb1 \
\cb3 front well\cb1 \
\cb3 thanks bye all right\cb1 \
\cb3 sorry about that um here's the thing i\cb1 \
\cb3 will say is\cb1 \
\cb3 you know most of people aren't going to\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to what you have to say\cb1 \
\cb3 um don't lose friendships over trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 help them\cb1 \
\cb3 but the women who really want to know\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll they'll ask you what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 doing\cb1 \
\cb3 um just make sure that you stay on the\cb1 \
\cb3 right path for you because\cb1 \
\cb3 um that's why i didn't ask about\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage but a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 some sort of relationship come up with\cb1 \
\cb3 what you want to have going for the rest\cb1 \
\cb3 of your life\cb1 \
\cb3 and as long as you're willing to work\cb1 \
\cb3 with a man to be cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot is possible i appreciate you\cb1 \
\cb3 calling insist\cb1 \
\cb3 yes sir appreciate you all right uh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 that was\cb1 \
\cb3 that was my food that was coming in so\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 let me go ahead and get rid of look man\cb1 \
\cb3 no different than if you're an rp guy\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't talk about some of this stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 to people who don't want to hear it\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but there gets a point in time there\cb1 \
\cb3 comes a point in time where everybody's\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of like well\cb1 \
\cb3 you know especially in the holidays\cb1 \
\cb3 taylor i mean hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hello yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 hi what do you got for me i'm good\cb1 \
\cb3 and um um yes because i\cb1 \
\cb3 am well i i grew up mostly in in the\cb1 \
\cb3 suburbs so i\cb1 \
\cb3 i grew up around a lot of white women\cb1 \
\cb3 okay how old are you by the way\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 23 23. um are you in college\cb1 \
\cb3 or out of college i'm in college but i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 about to take a gap year\cb1 \
\cb3 and focus on a personal trainer program\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh what kind of relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 do you want with a man um i\cb1 \
\cb3 want to date and then eventually become\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so uh were your mother and father\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 yes well my my mother is married to my\cb1 \
\cb3 stepdad not my biological father\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh do you have any siblings yes i\cb1 \
\cb3 have one brother\cb1 \
\cb3 so if i asked you why you want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 married you would tell me what\cb1 \
\cb3 that um my my mother and my my stepdad\cb1 \
\cb3 um really put it into in my head like\cb1 \
\cb3 they beat it in my head that you know\cb1 \
\cb3 monogamy and getting married and all\cb1 \
\cb3 that um\cb1 \
\cb3 is what you want to do preferably before\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 30.\cb1 \
\cb3 but why why do you want to do it though\cb1 \
\cb3 um because well i i still believe in\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 and the institution of marriage and and\cb1 \
\cb3 everything that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know um that a man can give to a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman a woman can give to a man and all\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 i i think um i just i'm with it\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's all i have to say about\cb1 \
\cb3 that i feel like it's um\cb1 \
\cb3 it's it's something that's supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 happen uh\cb1 \
\cb3 now see and here's what i want to add is\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not something that's supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 happen it must be deliberate\cb1 \
\cb3 and far too many of our sisters just\cb1 \
\cb3 assumed that it'll happen\cb1 \
\cb3 see the questions i'm asking you are\cb1 \
\cb3 questions you have to flush out\cb1 \
\cb3 because you have to be if you say you\cb1 \
\cb3 want something\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to be more clear i mean you\cb1 \
\cb3 said what are you gonna what are you\cb1 \
\cb3 pursuing for\cb1 \
\cb3 a degree path um\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm just gonna say just make this\cb1 \
\cb3 make it simple\cb1 \
\cb3 um exercise science basically\cb1 \
\cb3 kinesiology okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so when you put that's that's specific\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't just go to college and just\cb1 \
\cb3 take a bunch of classes\cb1 \
\cb3 and accomplish together and make\cb1 \
\cb3 something we have to be much more\cb1 \
\cb3 deliberate everything i've asked you is\cb1 \
\cb3 like your parents put it into you that's\cb1 \
\cb3 fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but you have to figure out what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 that you want\cb1 \
\cb3 and why it makes sense for you outside\cb1 \
\cb3 of you being with it\cb1 \
\cb3 it has to be far because this is the\cb1 \
\cb3 most this is the biggest\cb1 \
\cb3 choice any person can make who you mate\cb1 \
\cb3 with who you pair with\cb1 \
\cb3 uh can make or break you um so\cb1 \
\cb3 i would suggest really sitting down and\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding do you talk\cb1 \
\cb3 does your do your mother and father's\cb1 \
\cb3 your father help you vet men that you\cb1 \
\cb3 date\cb1 \
\cb3 um i've asked my my dad um for a um\cb1 \
\cb3 advice on guys before\cb1 \
\cb3 he he mostly takes the um stance that i\cb1 \
\cb3 should wait until i i\cb1 \
\cb3 graduate from college to start dating he\cb1 \
\cb3 thinks i should\cb1 \
\cb3 be more marketable that way that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what he tells me\cb1 \
\cb3 nope no well no you won't be more\cb1 \
\cb3 marketable when you graduate college\cb1 \
\cb3 just you'd have a degree um here's the\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 find out why you want are you a\cb1 \
\cb3 christian by the way\cb1 \
\cb3 um well this is complicated i was raised\cb1 \
\cb3 christian at the end of the day you have\cb1 \
\cb3 to understand why you want it\cb1 \
\cb3 other than that it's just it then being\cb1 \
\cb3 with it has to be more of a\cb1 \
\cb3 there has to be a sound reason well i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean yes i want to be able to pour into\cb1 \
\cb3 someone\cb1 \
\cb3 um that's it that's i get it but you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have to see\cb1 \
\cb3 everything you're saying does not\cb1 \
\cb3 require marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i keep pushing what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying you want to be able to point to\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody you have to be married to do\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage is a business marriage is a cut\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're religious it's a covenant but\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't approach\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage with the seriousness and the\cb1 \
\cb3 reverence\cb1 \
\cb3 you sound like you probably put more\cb1 \
\cb3 thought into\cb1 \
\cb3 what college you picked a degree plan\cb1 \
\cb3 than a mate\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's a problem we all have in\cb1 \
\cb3 western countries\cb1 \
\cb3 and what i'm saying is you have to put\cb1 \
\cb3 serious thought\cb1 \
\cb3 into it because it will not just happen\cb1 \
\cb3 it simply will not\cb1 \
\cb3 okay thanks this um that's something\cb1 \
\cb3 you gotta we have to start understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 this is as people\cb1 \
\cb3 we will it if it's meant to be it will\cb1 \
\cb3 happen that's [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 it will not we have to be deliberate\cb1 \
\cb3 uh maya you're up next\cb1 \
\cb3 my food is here i tell you man they've\cb1 \
\cb3 shut down relations with uh restaurants\cb1 \
\cb3 in la\cb1 \
\cb3 getting the steak delivered is not the\cb1 \
\cb3 same thing maya\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead mute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 hello hi\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no no no no no no no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no not gonna do that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not gonna come in saying white\cb1 \
\cb3 savior [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 seven okay so let me understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 you can say what you have to say but\cb1 \
\cb3 when you come in saying white\cb1 \
\cb3 savior you're automatically on the wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 side of this program\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing i said put a white person in a\cb1 \
\cb3 savior role\cb1 \
\cb3 well saying that white women black women\cb1 \
\cb3 can learn from\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to be very careful because\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me excuse me did you go to\cb1 \
\cb3 elementary school in this country\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i did how many white women did you\cb1 \
\cb3 have teaching you\cb1 \
\cb3 uh none you've had no white female\cb1 \
\cb3 teachers in your life\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely not and they're a disgrace\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 good let me help you on out i don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 to talk\cb1 \
\cb3 look lady\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm about to\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what let's do it let's do it\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead you have a point of view tell\cb1 \
\cb3 us why white women is such a disgrace\cb1 \
\cb3 maya\cb1 \
\cb3 first thing um ninth grade\cb1 \
\cb3 why don't you go ahead and cam up too\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just looking at this\cb1 \
\cb3 well i prefer not to i'm going to just\cb1 \
\cb3 stay on video only i'll come back and do\cb1 \
\cb3 it later\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would like to say that a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 white women are feminists\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on hold on you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 say what you have to say but you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to say you don't want to came up\cb1 \
\cb3 because of what\cb1 \
\cb3 um i prefer not to because i'm almost in\cb1 \
\cb3 bed it's 11 44 p.m but i just want to\cb1 \
\cb3 say a little statement that\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of them are feminists you have to\cb1 \
\cb3 be very careful with what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 promoting\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of black men we're trying to get\cb1 \
\cb3 us to become you know more submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 um he i have a boyfriend right now okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 and we're taking things slow right\cb1 \
\cb3 so let me get this straight if\cb1 \
\cb3 information comes from white people it's\cb1 \
\cb3 automatically\cb1 \
\cb3 what i don't disagree the information\cb1 \
\cb3 that comes from them is incorrect\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying that one what i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 so two plus two is four is different\cb1 \
\cb3 coming from white people why\cb1 \
\cb3 that is incorrect i don't disagree with\cb1 \
\cb3 that well\cb1 \
\cb3 you said that wait a minute now you said\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to be careful\cb1 \
\cb3 what white people teach you no yes\cb1 \
\cb3 be very because they have not taught up\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 correctly throughout the century they've\cb1 \
\cb3 taught us to hate ourselves\cb1 \
\cb3 so when you kind of give them all this\cb1 \
\cb3 credit that white women oh why don't you\cb1 \
\cb3 go to school\cb1 \
\cb3 no no i'm gonna give no no no that's not\cb1 \

\cb3 people in general and me being a black\cb1 \
\cb3 girl who can't grow up in wisconsin and\cb1 \
\cb3 25 now even when i have a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 with other black african-american women\cb1 \

\cb3 anything pertaining to the world and how\cb1 \
\cb3 the\cb1 \
\cb3 how in my views personally on how people\cb1 \
\cb3 should be respected in\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations and so on i'm usually\cb1 \
\cb3 somehow shut out still and told that i\cb1 \

\cb3 um since then i've had a couple\cb1 \
\cb3 six-month relationships and\cb1 \
\cb3 over the last year i just dated okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um is there any\cb1 \
\cb3 is there any particular reason why you\cb1 \
\cb3 moved back to wisconsin\cb1 \
\cb3 um i got out of the military okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so um trying to i would just assume that\cb1 \
\cb3 dating in wisconsin is going to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 challenge it is it's always been one\cb1 \
\cb3 so at 25\cb1 \
\cb3 um i would always suggest to\cb1 \
\cb3 women who are serious about wanting\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships to move where there are\cb1 \
\cb3 an abundance of single\cb1 \
\cb3 professional eligible\cb1 \
\cb3 men because you don't have time to waste\cb1 \
\cb3 like we do\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you have two more years before the\cb1 \
\cb3 quote-unquote danger zone\cb1 \
\cb3 that 27 to 35 right so yes\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're not if you i would i would\cb1 \
\cb3 strongly consider moving\cb1 \
\cb3 to a the nearest international city\cb1 \
\cb3 um what do you do what do you do for a\cb1 \
\cb3 living\cb1 \
\cb3 i i'm an x-ray tech okay you can do that\cb1 \
\cb3 anywhere\cb1 \
\cb3 yes yeah so get get on the next thing\cb1 \
\cb3 smoking and get out of wisconsin because\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 dating and that and i just you know i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't even need to go into the\cb1 \
\cb3 particulars of whom\cb1 \
\cb3 you know and if people and people like\cb1 \
\cb3 you out of the conversation just find a\cb1 \
\cb3 different\cb1 \
\cb3 find a broader group of friends you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have to try to convince people who\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to hear you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i let that woman go about our\cb1 \
\cb3 business we i wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 i ain't gonna be talking to folks like\cb1 \
\cb3 that in my daily life\cb1 \
\cb3 white saviors and carrying on the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 out of here you live in the united\cb1 \
\cb3 states of america\cb1 \
\cb3 being on the continent all right jess\cb1 \
\cb3 bye-bye oh\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead oh one other comment i had um\cb1 \
\cb3 when it came to um white women and\cb1 \
\cb3 giving advice my brother actually ended\cb1 \
\cb3 up marrying\cb1 \
\cb3 a oh a white woman that he\cb1 \
\cb3 dated throughout high school um she's\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely wonderful\cb1 \
\cb3 and just in general talking to her and\cb1 \
\cb3 in communicating with generally white\cb1 \
\cb3 people since i grew up here in wisconsin\cb1 \
\cb3 um i don't really see the issue of why\cb1 \
\cb3 the why there is so much tension\cb1 \
\cb3 due to the fact that like when you\cb1 \
\cb3 actually hear different people's points\cb1 \
\cb3 of views and actually listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 everything well\cb1 \
\cb3 some one person said it earlier i think\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 for the most part and it's not something\cb1 \
\cb3 that we like to admit that a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 have an inferiority complex with other\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 um whether real or imagined whether\cb1 \
\cb3 justified or unjustified\cb1 \
\cb3 uh and number two uh when you're\cb1 \
\cb3 at the quote unquote bottom of the\cb1 \
\cb3 sexual marketplace totem poll\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that as a group you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 really winning\cb1 \
\cb3 uh some defensiveness there um but\cb1 \
\cb3 you know like anybody who's bad at\cb1 \
\cb3 anything the only way to get better is\cb1 \
\cb3 practice i didn't do better i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 if you watch basketball shaq was\cb1 \
\cb3 horrible he had to get better so\cb1 \
\cb3 i appreciate it mom uh hopefully you'll\cb1 \
\cb3 get out of get out of wisconsin though\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm planning on it bye-bye thank\cb1 \
\cb3 you bye all right\cb1 \

\cb3 conversations um\cb1 \
\cb3 in regards to black men and how they can\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 better why\cb1 \
\cb3 why why yes why um\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess from my experience i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 sometimes black men\cb1 \
\cb3 are have let me down or\cb1 \
\cb3 because the black men have wet let me\cb1 \
\cb3 down\cb1 \
\cb3 or have not been the greatest let you\cb1 \
\cb3 down\cb1 \
\cb3 who no no who's let you down\cb1 \
\cb3 black men that i've dated how old are\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 34. you ever been married\cb1 \
\cb3 no any children no\cb1 \
\cb3 and what black man where's your father\cb1 \
\cb3 my father he's married to my mother okay\cb1 \
\cb3 and what's longest relationship you've\cb1 \
\cb3 ever had\cb1 \
\cb3 uh four years how long ago was that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh about\cb1 \
\cb3 10 years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 so you were in a relationship of 20 to\cb1 \
\cb3 24 in the last 10 years what are your\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships been like\cb1 \
\cb3 that's correct yeah what about the last\cb1 \
\cb3 10 years though\cb1 \
\cb3 um i've dated but right so\cb1 \
\cb3 so um is that your picture\cb1 \
\cb3 that's me yes how recent is that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh that was canadian thanksgiving so in\cb1 \
\cb3 october\cb1 \
\cb3 all right uh and how tall are you i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 five five\cb1 \
\cb3 dress size i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 dress size i'm about a 16.\cb1 \
\cb3 okay the reason i don't do what you ask\cb1 \
\cb3 is because we have\cb1 \
\cb3 hundreds and hundreds of we have had\cb1 \
\cb3 thousands of programs movies everything\cb1 \
\cb3 else for the last\cb1 \
\cb3 50 years discussing problems with black\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet when one black man decides to\cb1 \
\cb3 have a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 to talk to black women you black women\cb1 \
\cb3 act as though it's just the worst thing\cb1 \
\cb3 ever\cb1 \
\cb3 i spent five years talking to men\cb1 \
\cb3 but what is what does but you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the reason i ask all those questions\cb1 \
\cb3 man but you haven't had a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 in 10 years\cb1 \
\cb3 have you had therapy yes i have\cb1 \
\cb3 what'd your therapist say\cb1 \
\cb3 about in regards to what you said black\cb1 \
\cb3 men have let you down you ain't had a\cb1 \
\cb3 serious relationship in 10 years\cb1 \
\cb3 who's letting you down\cb1 \
\cb3 well in the dating you ain't had a\cb1 \
\cb3 serious relationship in 10 years\cb1 \
\cb3 who's letting you down\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not sure how to answer that question\cb1 \
\cb3 well you can answer the question if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 if your last serious relationship was 10\cb1 \
\cb3 years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 who's letting you down\cb1 \
\cb3 again i'm not sure what the answer\cb1 \
\cb3 you're looking for i know\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the longest relationship you've\cb1 \
\cb3 had in the last 10 years\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me what is the longest\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship you've had in the last 10\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 about six to a year six months to a year\cb1 \
\cb3 right you had a fourteen a four-year\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship ten years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have a series of short-term\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships you've been in therapy\cb1 \
\cb3 when did you end when was just are you\cb1 \
\cb3 still in therapy are you no longer\cb1 \
\cb3 having are you no longer in therapy um\cb1 \
\cb3 no longer at this time so when you say\cb1 \
\cb3 let you down i mean what break your\cb1 \
\cb3 heart cheat on you\cb1 \
\cb3 just decide they don't want to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 you what do you mean\cb1 \
\cb3 um a bit of all of that as well as just\cb1 \
\cb3 being high quality men\cb1 \
\cb3 um high quality and i don't even high\cb1 \
\cb3 quality meaning what\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so i will speak from my experience\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 being canadian the men here\cb1 \
\cb3 in toronto well not all but the\cb1 \
\cb3 percentage of\cb1 \
\cb3 men that i've come across um\cb1 \
\cb3 they come forth with the bare minimum so\cb1 \
\cb3 quality men being what income\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah income okay how much how much would\cb1 \
\cb3 you how much would you\cb1 \
\cb3 want a man to make in order to date you\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 say that part against these how much\cb1 \
\cb3 would you want a man to make in order to\cb1 \
\cb3 date you seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 i want a man to have a job and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 sometimes even hard to hear defining\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 well i hate to break this to you ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 but see you said\cb1 \
\cb3 men letting you down and i'm really\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to hear what you're having to say\cb1 \
\cb3 well really my conversation was really\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 you having having these conversations\cb1 \
\cb3 with men\cb1 \
\cb3 i wasn't aware of you well but the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 is you haven't you haven't done any\cb1 \
\cb3 research either\cb1 \
\cb3 all you have to do is look back at my\cb1 \
\cb3 catalog and you would see it\cb1 \
\cb3 but see when i get that question from\cb1 \
\cb3 women more often than not\cb1 \
\cb3 i find it interesting that you women\cb1 \
\cb3 often want to know well do you have any\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations with men because men are\cb1 \
\cb3 the real problem no ma'am you're the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem in your relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well let's start with number one\cb1 \
\cb3 why you address i-16\cb1 \
\cb3 um because i'm not active all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 what the main things that high caliber\cb1 \
\cb3 quality men want from women\cb1 \
\cb3 are them to be fit feminine and\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 you fail on the fitness component\cb1 \
\cb3 i agree so you don't qualify for\cb1 \
\cb3 a high caliber quality man\cb1 \
\cb3 that's your problem not ours\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so when you say men who fail you\cb1 \
\cb3 you're talking about lower caliber men\cb1 \
\cb3 but that's what you qualify for at\cb1 \
\cb3 address size 16.\cb1 \
\cb3 oh okay i mean is that new news to you\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean dress size 16 that puts you well\cb1 \
\cb3 over 200 pounds\cb1 \
\cb3 you weigh more than a man\cb1 \
\cb3 where do where do women who where way\cb1 \
\cb3 more than men get quality men\cb1 \
\cb3 you tell me please they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 okay kevin but the point is ma'am you\cb1 \
\cb3 asked me about the men\cb1 \
\cb3 and i said in without letting you speak\cb1 \
\cb3 and tell me your situation but the first\cb1 \
\cb3 thing that all you women could do if you\cb1 \
\cb3 want better interactions of men is to\cb1 \
\cb3 become fit\cb1 \
\cb3 that is the one thing black men across\cb1 \
\cb3 the board have been asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 years and you black women are not giving\cb1 \
\cb3 black men what they're even asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 i asked you why and you said because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're lazy\cb1 \
\cb3 then you get nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 you want better get in the gym lose the\cb1 \
\cb3 weight and you'll get better you'll\cb1 \
\cb3 attract a higher caliber man\cb1 \
\cb3 white women know that asian women know\cb1 \
\cb3 that hispanic women know that middle\cb1 \
\cb3 east women know that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why they're not they don't weigh\cb1 \
\cb3 more than their men\cb1 \
\cb3 something else she's learning from white\cb1 \
\cb3 women stop being bigger than black men\cb1 \
\cb3 say that part again please something\cb1 \
\cb3 else you can learn from white women stop\cb1 \
\cb3 being bigger than your men\cb1 \
\cb3 okay kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 that would help though right\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yeah i mean it's not just for the men\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe it would work\cb1 \
\cb3 better for myself as well to be fit okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so so if you know that\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're not doing anything about it\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 is not the men and that's what this show\cb1 \
\cb3 does\cb1 \
\cb3 i take i talk to women and i test what\cb1 \
\cb3 women say\cb1 \
\cb3 are the issues and i actually show what\cb1 \
\cb3 the real\cb1 \
\cb3 issue tends to be okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so back to videos on the men\cb1 \
\cb3 how far do i need to go back to that you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need to worry about the men ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 you're too big\cb1 \
\cb3 see you still want to go back to the men\cb1 \
\cb3 as if the men are the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 why is it so hard for you to sit down\cb1 \
\cb3 and say you know what he's right\cb1 \
\cb3 i am 200 and what pounds but i did say\cb1 \
\cb3 that kevin i did say\cb1 \
\cb3 no no but you still you said but going\cb1 \
\cb3 back okay what going back to video okay\cb1 \
\cb3 going back to videos to hear me talk to\cb1 \
\cb3 men is going to change\cb1 \
\cb3 what about your physical appearance\cb1 \
\cb3 you're right okay i know but the fact\cb1 \
\cb3 that the fact that i'm right\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact that i'm right doesn't change\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact that just like\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of black women like well whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever but i still want to know what i\cb1 \
\cb3 want to know ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot get a higher caliber of\cb1 \
\cb3 quality of man because\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't want women who weigh more than\cb1 \
\cb3 us\cb1 \
\cb3 so the problem is not the men but it's\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're basically showing\cb1 \
\cb3 is it's easier for you to accept the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem is over there\cb1 \
\cb3 than in the mirror\cb1 \
\cb3 and i don't understand as a young woman\cb1 \
\cb3 with no children\cb1 \
\cb3 why you've allowed yourself to be this\cb1 \
\cb3 way and continue to stay this way\cb1 \
\cb3 when you know it's not what men the\cb1 \
\cb3 caliber of man you want\cb1 \
\cb3 what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right in other words\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem ain't the man\cb1 \
\cb3 say it again you guys got a lot of nerve\cb1 \
\cb3 coming in asking about the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem with me when you weigh more than\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll take these last few and i gotta go\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 uh dj\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and mute yourself hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 getting black woman and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not afraid to hear what they have to\cb1 \
\cb3 say\cb1 \
\cb3 because at the end of the day they are\cb1 \
\cb3 women and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm young i'm only 23 so i have a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 learning i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 i should accept like i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 at the end of my journey i'm at the\cb1 \
\cb3 beginning and so\cb1 \

\cb3 gotta tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 as an image consultant right off the top\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \

\cb3 photo shoot actually i don't get it\cb1 \
\cb3 every day\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right so i said okay so\cb1 \
\cb3 the reason i asked because it made\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 i think personally as an image\cb1 \
\cb3 consultant black women have gone\cb1 \
\cb3 so extreme with their looks uh\cb1 \
\cb3 all this different color hair um\cb1 \
\cb3 lace fronts sew-ins\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know um\cb1 \
\cb3 less is more ma'am go back to the 1960s\cb1 \
\cb3 and 70s\cb1 \
\cb3 less is more and it will give you far\cb1 \
\cb3 better chance at attracting\cb1 \
\cb3 a quality man\cb1 \
\cb3 um that's across the board\cb1 \
\cb3 that was the first thing i keep on when\cb1 \
\cb3 you and i'm not gonna put it on camera\cb1 \
\cb3 but the first thing i keep on was that i\cb1 \
\cb3 was like that's not going to help you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's going to actually work against you\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you said you signed up with a\cb1 \
\cb3 matchmaker\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how tall are you i'm five two\cb1 \
\cb3 dress size um size\cb1 \
\cb3 8 to 10 depending on the dress and how\cb1 \
\cb3 much did you weigh last time you weighed\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 i was 160. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that's that's too heavy\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that right at 5 20. yeah i i\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 i know according to bmi and what you've\cb1 \
\cb3 been thinking about\cb1 \
\cb3 well yeah so these are things that you\cb1 \
\cb3 can do\cb1 \
\cb3 just to help you with the matchmaker or\cb1 \
\cb3 just walking around\cb1 \
\cb3 period you got to get closer to that\cb1 \
\cb3 dress size 4\cb1 \
\cb3 6 and then less is more\cb1 \
\cb3 man as far as a classic elegant\cb1 \
\cb3 appearance um you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i just leave it there that's going to\cb1 \
\cb3 give you the best shot at attracting\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 as far as keeping them you know that's\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 you know you can learn a lot from other\cb1 \
\cb3 women uh femininity instructors\cb1 \
\cb3 femininity coaches\cb1 \
\cb3 not something that i teach but i i sure\cb1 \

\cb3 daughter yes would you tell her\cb1 \

\cb3 i'm saying that i would you tell your\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter to let your weight go it won't\cb1 \
\cb3 affect you getting a man\cb1 \
\cb3 you it doesn't i mean i'm gonna say\cb1 \

\cb3 yourself be 200 pounds it won't affect\cb1 \
\cb3 you getting a man\cb1 \
\cb3 can i say one thing kevin well i have to\cb1 \
\cb3 answer my question\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm i'm gonna say that i i mean a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 my\cb1 \
\cb3 my you have not answered my question you\cb1 \
\cb3 have not answered my question you have\cb1 \
\cb3 not answered my\cb1 \
\cb3 you have not answered my question no no\cb1 \
\cb3 so all right well you have a good day um\cb1 \
\cb3 you get to take your big ass on because\cb1 \
\cb3 uh apparently you\cb1 \
\cb3 think being loud and combative i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 just over talking folks is gonna do so\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 black women as much as it may feel good\cb1 \
\cb3 to hear women like her\cb1 \
\cb3 say what she's saying it's not going to\cb1 \
\cb3 help you\cb1 \
\cb3 as much as you may not like the words\cb1 \
\cb3 that i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 they will help you just like the\cb1 \
\cb3 previous woman who wanted to discuss\cb1 \
\cb3 all the problems with men when she's a\cb1 \
\cb3 full dress size\cb1 \
\cb3 16 no ma'am you were closer to her 20.\cb1 \
\cb3 but i let the 16 ride\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't get quality men because\cb1 \
\cb3 quality men do not deal with women\cb1 \
\cb3 who don't want to be seen with women\cb1 \
\cb3 that weigh more than them\cb1 \
\cb3 and anyone who tells you as a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 allow yourself to let your weight go\cb1 \
\cb3 is your enemy black women\cb1 \
\cb3 that includes you too marie the previous\cb1 \
\cb3 caller as far as i'm concerned\cb1 \
\cb3 you're an enemy to black women i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 give a [ __ ] about\cb1 \
\cb3 what somebody does and send somebody to\cb1 \
\cb3 a fat farm\cb1 \
\cb3 that is stupid and we have too many\cb1 \
\cb3 women out here just telling women\cb1 \
\cb3 allow yourself to get big or whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 when\cb1 \
\cb3 26 of you will ever marry\cb1 \
\cb3 and when asked the question would you\cb1 \
\cb3 tell your daughter this\cb1 \
\cb3 shut that [ __ ] right up she had deflect\cb1 \
\cb3 deflect deflect deflect the flag because\cb1 \
\cb3 she know good and damn well\cb1 \
\cb3 that she'd have to live with her\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter if she allowed her dog to be\cb1 \
\cb3 200 some odd pounds\cb1 \
\cb3 because ain't nobody gonna take her\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter off our hands [ __ ] you mean\cb1 \
\cb3 come on girl you come on alicia\cb1 \
\cb3 you all laid up in the bed what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry i'm just having a good time\cb1 \
\cb3 laughing at these people\cb1 \
\cb3 it's amazing i know\cb1 \
\cb3 it's amazing what do you got for me so\cb1 \
\cb3 i just read the question and your\cb1 \
\cb3 question your original question\cb1 \
\cb3 i think was can white women\cb1 \
\cb3 teach black women how to\cb1 \
\cb3 to get high value black men because one\cb1 \
\cb3 of the things we tend to hear alicia is\cb1 \
\cb3 when a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 achieves a certain level of success he\cb1 \
\cb3 tends to turn\cb1 \
\cb3 get rid of his black woman and go get a\cb1 \
\cb3 white woman yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 all right if that's the case if we\cb1 \
\cb3 believe that\cb1 \
\cb3 then why because if they're getting them\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead yeah so i do believe that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know there is a strategy and there's\cb1 \
\cb3 a\cb1 \
\cb3 language and it's almost it's\cb1 \
\cb3 it's almost like a secret it's something\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of us black women don't know about\cb1 \
\cb3 because we haven't been taught it\cb1 \
\cb3 from day one like they've been taught it\cb1 \
\cb3 it's almost like a math equation and if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not good at math\cb1 \
\cb3 you haven't practiced it long enough you\cb1 \
\cb3 know i think you can do math you can\cb1 \
\cb3 learn math if you practice it you\cb1 \
\cb3 practice and you understand\cb1 \
\cb3 the um the standards of operations you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 the basics on how to figure out the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem how to solve the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to have some some knowledge\cb1 \
\cb3 about how\cb1 \
\cb3 the education right so we haven't been\cb1 \
\cb3 educated they know\cb1 \
\cb3 and they know what to do and it's almost\cb1 \
\cb3 like white women to me\cb1 \
\cb3 approach it like psychopaths and if you\cb1 \
\cb3 study a psychopath a psychopathic person\cb1 \
\cb3 is very methodical they're very\cb1 \
\cb3 intentional\cb1 \
\cb3 they're very manipulative they know\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's how i see a lot of white\cb1 \
\cb3 women when it comes to black men in\cb1 \
\cb3 particular\cb1 \
\cb3 they are like psychopaths over there now\cb1 \
\cb3 psychopaths like the\cb1 \
\cb3 the key the dark triad is with\cb1 \
\cb3 psychopathy and there's a lot i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 again the the part of being of the the\cb1 \
\cb3 the dark triad of personality traits\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a lack of empathy so i'm i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 little i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 when you say psychopath i i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 if i'll go there\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would just say you know because\cb1 \
\cb3 that that\cb1 \
\cb3 that that implies\cb1 \
\cb3 a malicious intent and i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 allow you just to say that white women\cb1 \
\cb3 go after black men with malicious intent\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 that's just not fair i would think it\cb1 \
\cb3 would be fair to say\cb1 \
\cb3 is they're very strategic about their\cb1 \
\cb3 mating choices\cb1 \
\cb3 right and black women and black women\cb1 \
\cb3 need to be as well\cb1 \
\cb3 right i had a man one time tell me that\cb1 \
\cb3 i needed to separate my body\cb1 \
\cb3 from my emotions and i think that\cb1 \
\cb3 i won't generalize but i i'd say that\cb1 \
\cb3 in order to really\cb1 \
\cb3 be more successful in the process of\cb1 \
\cb3 choosing\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman has to be able to do that and\cb1 \
\cb3 for\cb1 \
\cb3 me as a black woman with all of my\cb1 \
\cb3 sensitivity\cb1 \
\cb3 i it's hard for me to separate but\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the problem here's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no not anyway not anywhere you\cb1 \
\cb3 know that don't work here here's what\cb1 \
\cb3 happens\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of in the black community we have\cb1 \
\cb3 made what you just said\cb1 \
\cb3 a virtue because now sis you're keeping\cb1 \
\cb3 it real\cb1 \
\cb3 you're being true to yourself and here's\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 the outcome is what i worry about\cb1 \
\cb3 and you said it they other groups of\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 learn to approach mating strategically\cb1 \
\cb3 and they get better outcomes that's\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 and and you're not getting the outcome\cb1 \
\cb3 so i cannot allow\cb1 \
\cb3 a losing outcome to be virtuous because\cb1 \
\cb3 it will\cb1 \
\cb3 engender more people to lose nope i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to call it losing and saying you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to pract better i'm not going to\cb1 \
\cb3 let it be called psychopath ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 psychopathic\cb1 \
\cb3 i'ma just say they're beating i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know where you're from but michael\cb1 \
\cb3 jordan people\cb1 \
\cb3 michael jordan people say he's like a\cb1 \
\cb3 psychopath out there\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen listen listen competitors\cb1 \
\cb3 often border the mamba mentality michael\cb1 \
\cb3 jordan\cb1 \
\cb3 competitors tend to want to win\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the net of it that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 characteristic of psychopathy\cb1 \
\cb3 no but okay you're trying to make i\cb1 \
\cb3 can't let you say that\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't let you i mean it's the\cb1 \
\cb3 character no i can't no no it's a no\cb1 \
\cb3 no i can't allow you to do what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to do man you're trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 basically say\cb1 \
\cb3 white women are psychopathic i can't do\cb1 \
\cb3 that no no no no no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah it's the wrong word it's the\cb1 \
\cb3 wrong word and it's a loaded word\cb1 \
\cb3 and i can't do that right i don't mean\cb1 \
\cb3 to the to the exact description no\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely not but they're just traits\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 can appear like that and well how about\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't allow that to be said but i will\cb1 \
\cb3 say this they're kicking y'all's ass\cb1 \
\cb3 well you know hey\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of ass kicking a lot of ass\cb1 \
\cb3 kicking over here\cb1 \
\cb3 well the problem is and the thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 it's time for black women to realize\cb1 \
\cb3 there's no virtue in losing you're\cb1 \
\cb3 losing\cb1 \
\cb3 one in four of you will marry in your\cb1 \
\cb3 lifetime it's not winning\cb1 \
\cb3 and so many women are so many black\cb1 \
\cb3 women have become proud to be\cb1 \
\cb3 losers so i got my people a dog and\cb1 \
\cb3 everything else but you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 right everybody else is winning no no\cb1 \
\cb3 look at kim kardashian and look at\cb1 \
\cb3 look at this they're winning you better\cb1 \
\cb3 learn how to win but i got to get my\cb1 \
\cb3 food i'm hungry\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate you calling in man bye-bye\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i can't i can't all right yeah that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's like\cb1 \
\cb3 that psychopath nah man that that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's too much\cb1 \
\cb3 i get what you were trying to say but\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's that's that's\cb1 \
\cb3 nah i can't i can't have that man that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's that's bad um but at the\cb1 \
\cb3 end of the day\cb1 \
\cb3 winning uh dennis sperling says they can\cb1 \
\cb3 learn\cb1 \
\cb3 they can learn from white women asian\cb1 \
\cb3 women and latino women how to get\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value black men\cb1 \
\cb3 but they won't because they refuse to\cb1 \
\cb3 compete for high-value black men\cb1 \
\cb3 because they think they are better than\cb1 \
\cb3 us and we aren't worth it uncle d\cb1 \
\cb3 hey man and that and that ship is sailed\cb1 \
\cb3 men realize their value and here's where\cb1 \
\cb3 we're at\cb1 \
\cb3 look at your left ring finger look down\cb1 \
\cb3 and see\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have a wedding ring of it a man\cb1 \
\cb3 of value\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever that meant a valuable man a man\cb1 \
\cb3 of value\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that other women wish they had if\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have one\cb1 \
\cb3 i think this is a good show i think\cb1 \
\cb3 there are a lot of things that came out\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you ladies continue to ask me\cb1 \
\cb3 well do you ever talk to the men\cb1 \
\cb3 look\cb1 \
\cb3 stop it the man out the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 i've said in a previous broadcast black\cb1 \
\cb3 women you're more blessed than you're\cb1 \
\cb3 willing to acknowledge\cb1 \
\cb3 uh black men uh still want to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 black women after all of this stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 you're fortunate generation x\cb1 \
\cb3 half of the millennials but these zenios\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of zenios are like i ain't even\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to go down this path\cb1 \
\cb3 at the end of the day it's up to you as\cb1 \
\cb3 an individual woman to decide what you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to do\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a cultural and a group component\cb1 \
\cb3 but you better learn how to\cb1 \
\cb3 are you going to win are you going to\cb1 \
\cb3 die alone\cb1 \

\cb3 and my job is to help you guys look good\cb1 \
\cb3 smell great and be your best each and\cb1 \
\cb3 every\cb1 \
\cb3 day but let's be for real most of you\cb1 \
\cb3 over here because\cb1 \
\cb3 over here we talk about relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 between men\cb1 \
\cb3 women and we get on into the whole\cb1 \
\cb3 notion of\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it that you're willing to do to\cb1 \
\cb3 get the kind of woman\cb1 \
\cb3 or man you want a lot of this stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 high value has been around high value\cb1 \
\cb3 high value\cb1 \
\cb3 so yeah even though i did not make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't make up the terms high value i\cb1 \
\cb3 have popularized it so we're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 continue to go on\cb1 \
\cb3 now high value ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what a high value man is and\cb1 \
\cb3 for those of you don't remember\cb1 \
\cb3 let's run them down real quick first off\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 starts with money assuming you live in a\cb1 \
\cb3 place where the cost of living is about\cb1 \
\cb3 a hundred percent\cb1 \
\cb3 dallas houston austin atlanta starts\cb1 \
\cb3 around ten thousand dollars a month\cb1 \
\cb3 10k a month in atlanta dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 and that man needs to make that money\cb1 \
\cb3 for at least\cb1 \
\cb3 five years around three years he's\cb1 \
\cb3 scratching the surface\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most important aspects of\cb1 \
\cb3 being a high value man is\cb1 \
\cb3 group acceptance other high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 must see you as a peer\cb1 \
\cb3 so again this whole notion of high value\cb1 \
\cb3 loaners\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of funny to me next network of high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 and others your network is your net\cb1 \
\cb3 worth\cb1 \
\cb3 your net worth is your network you need\cb1 \
\cb3 to have a network\cb1 \
\cb3 number five visibility you know\cb1 \
\cb3 being a high value hermit is kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 defeats the point\cb1 \
\cb3 linkedin level meaning your life your\cb1 \
\cb3 your your status\cb1 \
\cb3 is pretty much known at a glance i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm ahead of cardiac i'm the head of\cb1 \
\cb3 cardiology\cb1 \
\cb3 at john hopkins or i'm an entrepreneur\cb1 \
\cb3 those two things one doesn't have people\cb1 \
\cb3 asking many questions\cb1 \
\cb3 another leads only two more questions\cb1 \
\cb3 and lastly and probably one of the most\cb1 \
\cb3 important things and these are in no\cb1 \
\cb3 particular order except with the money\cb1 \
\cb3 it has to start with money you must be\cb1 \
\cb3 useful to others\cb1 \
\cb3 and the group these are the\cb1 \
\cb3 steps essence traits tips of being a\cb1 \
\cb3 high\cb1 \
\cb3 value man now what i did is i asked\cb1 \
\cb3 myself\cb1 \
\cb3 over any time frame in life\cb1 \
\cb3 who are the men who've actually\cb1 \
\cb3 separated themselves from the pack this\cb1 \
\cb3 is what happens\cb1 \
\cb3 when you don't actually cut the wick\cb1 \
\cb3 so let that do what it's going to do i\cb1 \
\cb3 ask myself over any length of time what\cb1 \
\cb3 are the men who have separated\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 um and become the top of the pack\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man has nothing to do with\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 being a high value man has nothing to do\cb1 \
\cb3 with women but\cb1 \
\cb3 women are a part of it that's the show\cb1 \
\cb3 countdown timer\cb1 \
\cb3 to keep us kind of on track and we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to run this along the bottom so to\cb1 \
\cb3 make sure\cb1 \
\cb3 i can support the channel but no but\cb1 \
\cb3 let's be real\cb1 \
\cb3 tonight you showed up oh fragrance of\cb1 \
\cb3 the day\cb1 \
\cb3 dior feb delicios oh one of the best\cb1 \
\cb3 tonka fragrances\cb1 \
\cb3 on the planet in a fall winter staple\cb1 \
\cb3 this has been uh knocking them down all\cb1 \
\cb3 day\cb1 \
\cb3 long all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 in order to be\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry in order to be a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 it's it's really important that people\cb1 \
\cb3 who are already high value\cb1 \
\cb3 say you're part of the group that's what\cb1 \
\cb3 bothers a lot of guys a lot of people\cb1 \
\cb3 are upset because\cb1 \
\cb3 oh you can't i say you can't be high\cb1 \
\cb3 value and homeless\cb1 \
\cb3 you know we had a they're always\cb1 \
\cb3 interesting discussions\cb1 \
\cb3 but who decides who's high value\cb1 \
\cb3 the market the world can't\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't just self-proclaim yourself as\cb1 \
\cb3 high you cannot just just\cb1 \
\cb3 proclaim yourself as high value the\cb1 \
\cb3 market gets to decide and the market\cb1 \
\cb3 is the world and the world is made up of\cb1 \
\cb3 men and women\cb1 \
\cb3 um men that are higher value to other\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 may or may not be the same as the men\cb1 \
\cb3 that are high value to women but let's\cb1 \
\cb3 get on into it\cb1 \
\cb3 what is a high value woman this is a\cb1 \
\cb3 question that keeps coming up well\cb1 \
\cb3 we get it god we get got we get it\cb1 \
\cb3 godfather\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man is something rare it's\cb1 \
\cb3 special or else it wouldn't be\cb1 \
\cb3 it wouldn't be necessary\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most important things is i\cb1 \
\cb3 see so many people trying to wedge\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 into a category that honestly they may\cb1 \
\cb3 not fit so let's do this\cb1 \
\cb3 2500 people here we only got 46\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars that come on man hear what\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna do a little dollar sign\cb1 \
\cb3 down at the bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 come on man show some love in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 do something up there real quick because\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 being\cb1 \
\cb3 these things cost money let's look at\cb1 \
\cb3 the definition of high\cb1 \
\cb3 what does high mean\cb1 \
\cb3 more than average unusual\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what it means to be high more\cb1 \
\cb3 than average or unusual\cb1 \
\cb3 so if it's more than average unusual\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the overall definition of high\cb1 \
\cb3 more than the norm\cb1 \
\cb3 high value and i don't actually you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i wonder that i don't want to i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to break all this down we know what\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value mean is\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and if you don't know you're about\cb1 \
\cb3 to learn real quick\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to uh orange auto llc\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 is much more of a static\cb1 \
\cb3 concept either you are or you are not a\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 but the question is\cb1 \
\cb3 if there's a high value man is there\cb1 \
\cb3 such thing as a high\cb1 \
\cb3 value woman well\cb1 \
\cb3 for the sake of this conversation i will\cb1 \
\cb3 say yes\cb1 \
\cb3 there is a high value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 more than anything else\cb1 \
\cb3 it is linked to her usefulness\cb1 \
\cb3 to men i know it's going to take some\cb1 \
\cb3 women off but that's the truth ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 being a high value woman and a being of\cb1 \
\cb3 just like\cb1 \
\cb3 as a man you must be useful to others\cb1 \
\cb3 and the group\cb1 \
\cb3 uh frankly to be a truly high value\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you must be useful to others in the\cb1 \
\cb3 group\cb1 \
\cb3 in particular men\cb1 \
\cb3 so all my feminists are probably going\cb1 \
\cb3 to start getting upset saying you cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 be high value\cb1 \
\cb3 and not necessarily and not and without\cb1 \
\cb3 with um irrespective of a man\cb1 \
\cb3 and i say no when you go look up high\cb1 \
\cb3 value woman high value woman high value\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 2.6 billion hits will come back on high\cb1 \
\cb3 value women\cb1 \
\cb3 versus high value women and you'll hear\cb1 \
\cb3 things like this a high value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 is many things but above all she is a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who knows her value\cb1 \
\cb3 and only wants people in her life who\cb1 \
\cb3 values her\cb1 \
\cb3 too she owns loves and respects herself\cb1 \
\cb3 and knows her\cb1 \
\cb3 life is no less abundant without a man\cb1 \
\cb3 in it\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's what it makes her a high\cb1 \
\cb3 value woman and that is straight up bs\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies like it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 that stuff you've been fed by a womanist\cb1 \
\cb3 feminist\cb1 \
\cb3 don't work for you this whole i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 need a man\cb1 \
\cb3 uh look ladies make no mistake\cb1 \
\cb3 as human beings you are judged ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 by the caliber and the caliber of men\cb1 \
\cb3 you attract\cb1 \
\cb3 but more importantly than you can that\cb1 \
\cb3 that you\cb1 \
\cb3 keep\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why this whole thing is taken off\cb1 \
\cb3 so much because it's a real-time\cb1 \
\cb3 progress report for men to say where do\cb1 \
\cb3 i rank\cb1 \
\cb3 and for women to actually say well what\cb1 \
\cb3 about the men that i say that i want\cb1 \
\cb3 what do they what they want me\cb1 \
\cb3 keeping a man\cb1 \
\cb3 must want to keep you\cb1 \
\cb3 why is that important because that shows\cb1 \
\cb3 the world the market that you\cb1 \
\cb3 are and an asset\cb1 \
\cb3 let's look up the definition for assets\cb1 \
\cb3 shall we\cb1 \
\cb3 let's look up the definition for asset\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 asset definition the simple definition\cb1 \
\cb3 for asset means\cb1 \
\cb3 a useful or valuable thing person or\cb1 \
\cb3 quality\cb1 \
\cb3 to be an asset you must be useful useful\cb1 \
\cb3 to who\cb1 \
\cb3 useful to a man useful to the market the\cb1 \
\cb3 market is men\cb1 \
\cb3 being useful to women may feel may make\cb1 \
\cb3 you feel good\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's incomplete\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value woman in her simplest sense\cb1 \
\cb3 is a feminine asset\cb1 \
\cb3 she is a feminine asset in her simplest\cb1 \
\cb3 form\cb1 \
\cb3 great what are some things that make her\cb1 \
\cb3 high value let's get into it ready\cb1 \
\cb3 uh 2 900 people watching 370.\cb1 \
\cb3 and in the chat room i want you guys to\cb1 \
\cb3 keep it simple keep it cool people can\cb1 \
\cb3 have differing opinions\cb1 \
\cb3 but keep it respectful first let's start\cb1 \
\cb3 with the a's\cb1 \
\cb3 first off oh the chat is moving\cb1 \
\cb3 i think we need to slow the chat down\cb1 \
\cb3 i was catching up\cb1 \
\cb3 first the first two ways\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value woman is attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 and appealing now understand\cb1 \
\cb3 she is these things to three to three\cb1 \
\cb3 components\cb1 \
\cb3 of a human being mind body spirit soul\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever word you want to use a high\cb1 \
\cb3 value woman is attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 to the mind to the body and the spirit\cb1 \
\cb3 of a man she's appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 to the same things what does she need to\cb1 \
\cb3 be attractive well\cb1 \
\cb3 this is where this whole notion of\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty comes in\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are some things that are\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty much standard\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty while it may be in the eye of the\cb1 \
\cb3 beholder\cb1 \
\cb3 it is still objective there's an\cb1 \
\cb3 objective standard of beauty\cb1 \
\cb3 and a fitness component is there so it's\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 is attractive and appealing and in those\cb1 \
\cb3 subcategories\cb1 \
\cb3 there has to be a fitness in there you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't see many women considered to be\cb1 \
\cb3 high value\cb1 \
\cb3 morbidly obese\cb1 \
\cb3 but to don't but to go completely down\cb1 \
\cb3 the rabbit hole on looks\cb1 \
\cb3 would be to cheapen it because just\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 you are attractive notice i didn't say\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 i said attractive but you must be\cb1 \
\cb3 more than just attractive it must be\cb1 \
\cb3 appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 appealing those two things\cb1 \
\cb3 are linked attractive and unappealing\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't matter\cb1 \
\cb3 appealing and unattractive doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 matter they're linked\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive and appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 think of some of women who were would\cb1 \
\cb3 have been considered high value\cb1 \
\cb3 throughout time\cb1 \
\cb3 they were both attractive and appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 to mind body spirit\cb1 \
\cb3 of a man to the market to the man to to\cb1 \
\cb3 the masses\cb1 \
\cb3 to her city her church her community\cb1 \
\cb3 and how does she become this way well\cb1 \
\cb3 one she understands that\cb1 \
\cb3 her beauty\cb1 \
\cb3 is currency she doesn't let herself go\cb1 \
\cb3 she takes care of her appearance because\cb1 \
\cb3 her appearance makes her more appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 and thus more attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 can you be a high value woman and be\cb1 \
\cb3 unattractive and unappealing\cb1 \
\cb3 no\cb1 \
\cb3 next\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a comforting character\cb1 \
\cb3 she is comfort to her man\cb1 \
\cb3 she is comfort to her children she is\cb1 \
\cb3 comfort to her family\cb1 \
\cb3 she is comfort to those she cares about\cb1 \
\cb3 comforting character this is what so\cb1 \
\cb3 many people think about you know\cb1 \
\cb3 the ability to soothe\cb1 \
\cb3 this is where so many women lose today\cb1 \
\cb3 with their masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 desire to be ambitious and driven you\cb1 \
\cb3 lose the comforting character\cb1 \
\cb3 that women 100 50 70 80 100 years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 did not have your your phds i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 and your degrees and everything else but\cb1 \
\cb3 there was a softness to them\cb1 \
\cb3 when you sat up in your grandma's lap\cb1 \
\cb3 you hand she's that woman that can you\cb1 \
\cb3 hand the crying baby to\cb1 \
\cb3 and the baby gets quiet\cb1 \
\cb3 she's also that for her man she's his\cb1 \
\cb3 peace\cb1 \
\cb3 part of her character is the ability to\cb1 \
\cb3 comfort\cb1 \
\cb3 comfort in her character and her\cb1 \
\cb3 character is beyond reproach\cb1 \
\cb3 no one's gonna sit up and call a\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value woman and say she's out in\cb1 \
\cb3 the streets\cb1 \
\cb3 she see her character gets her gives her\cb1 \
\cb3 the benefit of the doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm about to go there uh with today's\cb1 \
\cb3 social media\cb1 \
\cb3 and the instant i've watched many\cb1 \
\cb3 podcasts asking is\cb1 \
\cb3 um is\cb1 \
\cb3 is loyalty possible in a social media\cb1 \
\cb3 age\cb1 \
\cb3 or is just cheating at the default\cb1 \
\cb3 setting\cb1 \
\cb3 well when with a woman of character she\cb1 \
\cb3 gets the benefit of the doubts\cb1 \
\cb3 high value women's character sets them\cb1 \
\cb3 apart from\cb1 \
\cb3 others even on an\cb1 \
\cb3 off day where she may respond in a way\cb1 \
\cb3 where other people may say man she's\cb1 \
\cb3 being a real business\cb1 \
\cb3 she'll get the benefit of doubt because\cb1 \
\cb3 her character has stand\cb1 \
\cb3 stands her apart\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so she's appealing and\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a comforting character\cb1 \
\cb3 she's comforting to her man's mind\cb1 \
\cb3 she's comforting to his body and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 comforting to his spirit\cb1 \
\cb3 yep same thing with her like i said her\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 her friends she's the one\cb1 \
\cb3 that everyone looks to\cb1 \
\cb3 if not she wouldn't be special\cb1 \
\cb3 now we're about to get into it\cb1 \
\cb3 now we're about to get into it go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 and get the likes up people\cb1 \
\cb3 now we're about to get into it see being\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 something that many women can\cb1 \
\cb3 can hit on being appealing is more is\cb1 \
\cb3 more difficult\cb1 \
\cb3 still possible a comforting character is\cb1 \
\cb3 a choice\cb1 \
\cb3 it can be done but it requires a certain\cb1 \
\cb3 mindset\cb1 \
\cb3 and what's the next part of it she has\cb1 \
\cb3 she is discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 and she is disciplined this is where\cb1 \
\cb3 most women fall apart\cb1 \
\cb3 because the discipline remember when i\cb1 \
\cb3 said she's attractive and then in the\cb1 \
\cb3 attractiveness\cb1 \
\cb3 in the appealing part there's a beauty\cb1 \
\cb3 component and a fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 without discipline you cannot remain fit\cb1 \
\cb3 see the discipline part means she was\cb1 \
\cb3 able to sit\cb1 \
\cb3 under masculine authority and not chafe\cb1 \
\cb3 she understands that the man that she\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to lead has to do things in a\cb1 \
\cb3 certain way\cb1 \
\cb3 and she has discipline enough that's not\cb1 \
\cb3 not need to sit there and question\cb1 \
\cb3 everything he's doing\cb1 \
\cb3 she's disciplined enough to get up early\cb1 \
\cb3 do what she needs to do\cb1 \
\cb3 make sure that the house the kids her\cb1 \
\cb3 job\cb1 \
\cb3 baba whatever she tru whatever she does\cb1 \
\cb3 she's disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is why fitness is so important\cb1 \
\cb3 because to lead a fit\cb1 \
\cb3 life requires the discipline diet\cb1 \
\cb3 an exercise regimen beauty routine\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 separates so many women\cb1 \
\cb3 you can see a woman who is disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 and men\cb1 \
\cb3 value that in her it also leads back\cb1 \
\cb3 into her character because it requires\cb1 \
\cb3 character to be disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 many women follow right here the\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 if you've been around a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 who's disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 she keeps herself there's a standard\cb1 \
\cb3 everywhere she goes there's a standard\cb1 \
\cb3 she sets a standard\cb1 \
\cb3 cleanliness the way she carries herself\cb1 \
\cb3 the way she you can't talk to a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who is disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 men will clean up their language in the\cb1 \
\cb3 presence of a disciplined woman\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i'm sorry ma'am boys will be boys\cb1 \
\cb3 if men just let it all hang out when\cb1 \
\cb3 you're around\cb1 \
\cb3 there you go next\cb1 \
\cb3 she's discerning and this is another one\cb1 \
\cb3 where most women fall apart\cb1 \
\cb3 the double d's discerning see a\cb1 \
\cb3 discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 a discerning discernment simply means\cb1 \
\cb3 good judgment\cb1 \
\cb3 you can look at a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 disciplined but look at her friends\cb1 \
\cb3 and to see whether or not she's\cb1 \
\cb3 discerning if she hangs around with a\cb1 \
\cb3 bunch of ragged muffins\cb1 \
\cb3 and tatianas skip\cb1 \
\cb3 but good judgment discernment she it can\cb1 \
\cb3 be\cb1 \
\cb3 trusted\cb1 \
\cb3 she trusts her own judgment so when men\cb1 \
\cb3 when her man says we got to go over here\cb1 \
\cb3 and take this risk\cb1 \
\cb3 her answer is yes because she can run\cb1 \
\cb3 all the numbers\cb1 \
\cb3 and understands what he's trying to do\cb1 \
\cb3 and sit back and say well if he's going\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 i can make this happen here discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 and discipline are extremely important\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman of discernment\cb1 \
\cb3 well i'm not going to go to this party\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not going to go to this event\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm a woman of a certain caliber\cb1 \
\cb3 and being in these environments will\cb1 \
\cb3 make me look bad\cb1 \
\cb3 to potential employers uh\cb1 \
\cb3 men whatever and see this goes across\cb1 \
\cb3 the board whether she's married or\cb1 \
\cb3 unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 see and you may not have\cb1 \
\cb3 need to have phds and all those other\cb1 \
\cb3 things but it requires an intelligent\cb1 \
\cb3 woman to navigate these things\cb1 \
\cb3 see the there's a huge misnomer that\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men wants\cb1 \
\cb3 just arm candy and bimbos\cb1 \
\cb3 not hardly\cb1 \
\cb3 so what and why do you\cb1 \
\cb3 side values less than two percent of the\cb1 \
\cb3 population and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's according to you\cb1 \
\cb3 see what really bothers a lot of people\cb1 \
\cb3 is they're not this\cb1 \
\cb3 let's just be let's just be right let's\cb1 \
\cb3 be honest this this makes a lot of guys\cb1 \
\cb3 chafe\cb1 \
\cb3 because they're not there\cb1 \
\cb3 less than three percent of population is\cb1 \
\cb3 over six foot two\cb1 \
\cb3 what's your point\cb1 \
\cb3 it only matters to you if you if you\cb1 \
\cb3 feel some kind of way by not being there\cb1 \
\cb3 and it doesn't change the fact that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what people want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 i would and some of you guys when you\cb1 \
\cb3 sit around here well\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard men think that well there is\cb1 \
\cb3 no such thing as a high value man you're\cb1 \
\cb3 a straight-up fool\cb1 \
\cb3 you walk out of the house and there's a\cb1 \
\cb3 ranking system\cb1 \
\cb3 so if you want to cry about high value\cb1 \
\cb3 go elsewhere it is what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 and if it's two percent the question is\cb1 \
\cb3 which part are you in\cb1 \
\cb3 and how do you feel about it because\cb1 \
\cb3 apparently\cb1 \
\cb3 that that super chat let's go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 go back to this let me go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 highlight this\cb1 \

\cb3 your two dollars because you because you\cb1 \

\cb3 just cry baby i can't stand you\cb1 \
\cb3 crybabies\cb1 \

\cb3 woman says i wanna\cb1 \
\cb3 i want a high value man and he and his\cb1 \
\cb3 response is well you do know\cb1 \
\cb3 that only two percent of the men are\cb1 \
\cb3 high value\cb1 \
\cb3 or what that oh what do you think she's\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna do oh really\cb1 \

\cb3 average woman well only there's only two\cb1 \
\cb3 i want one of the twenty well fi then\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll take you\cb1 \
\cb3 now they'll stand in line for the two\cb1 \
\cb3 percent why you guys over here\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is a problem with a lot of guys\cb1 \
\cb3 you think being right makes you a winner\cb1 \

\cb3 learned this being right doesn't make\cb1 \
\cb3 you a winner\cb1 \
\cb3 number the next parts so we got the a\cb1 \
\cb3 she's appealing and attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a comforting character she's\cb1 \
\cb3 discerning and disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you guys can a lot of women can\cb1 \
\cb3 just shuffle themselves out of here\cb1 \
\cb3 right there discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 good judgment discipline i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 disciplined\cb1 \
\cb3 because the next two\cb1 \
\cb3 she's enthusiastic and exuberant\cb1 \
\cb3 enthusiasm\cb1 \
\cb3 she's like a kid or a puppy\cb1 \
\cb3 in her approach to the market\cb1 \
\cb3 what does that mean puppies are always\cb1 \
\cb3 happy to see you\cb1 \
\cb3 kids act like wow\cb1 \

\cb3 guys oh my\cb1 \
\cb3 kids will make you happy about simple\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 now the adult and me will tell you that\cb1 \
\cb3 the fragrance in here is three thousand\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 for 100 ml of it the kid\cb1 \
\cb3 cares about the bottle if you're a\cb1 \
\cb3 parent\cb1 \
\cb3 and you've ever bought a kid a fancy\cb1 \
\cb3 gift and they have more fun with the box\cb1 \
\cb3 they taught us a lesson and far too many\cb1 \
\cb3 women today have lost their kid-like\cb1 \
\cb3 puppy-like enthusiasm\cb1 \
\cb3 you're supposed to be and character\cb1 \
\cb3 your man comes through the door or you\cb1 \
\cb3 see your man after whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 and does he get enthusiasm from you\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the last thing you were\cb1 \
\cb3 enthusiastic about\cb1 \
\cb3 ask you what you want oh then out comes\cb1 \
\cb3 the enthusiasm\cb1 \
\cb3 but when it comes to asking about what\cb1 \
\cb3 he wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 do you prepare a meal with enthusiasm do\cb1 \
\cb3 you clean with enthusiasm do you\cb1 \
\cb3 do you make love with enthusiasm\cb1 \
\cb3 is there an exuberance about you\cb1 \
\cb3 this zest for life do people feel\cb1 \
\cb3 lighter brighter better in your presence\cb1 \
\cb3 there's just something about her\cb1 \
\cb3 she's enthusiastic and exuberant\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a lightness to her she makes the\cb1 \
\cb3 world feel lighter and she lightens\cb1 \
\cb3 up she brightens up any place\cb1 \
\cb3 now you masculine strong independent i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need no man\cb1 \
\cb3 rest and be faced women the only thing\cb1 \
\cb3 you're exuberant about is arguing\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what turns you on oh i'll argue\cb1 \
\cb3 with you all day long\cb1 \
\cb3 that's you're exuberant about arguing\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why you're not high value\cb1 \
\cb3 enthusiastic and exuberant\cb1 \
\cb3 all right telling you\cb1 \
\cb3 you can learn from a woman who got this\cb1 \
\cb3 mastered\cb1 \
\cb3 that enthusiastic and exuberance uh\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the funny thing you i\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm you don't have to be a dime piece to\cb1 \
\cb3 be high value\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact the more enthusiastic and\cb1 \
\cb3 exuberant you are the more discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 and disciplined you are the more you\cb1 \
\cb3 comforting character you are\cb1 \
\cb3 the less hot you have to be hot damn\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have to be a dime piece if you\cb1 \
\cb3 got these other ones because they're\cb1 \
\cb3 intangibles\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a selfless spirit a giving of and\cb1 \
\cb3 guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 if you watch my channel i say men should\cb1 \
\cb3 be confident intelligent and assertive\cb1 \
\cb3 cia women should be feminine beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 and inspirational we know what feminine\cb1 \
\cb3 is or is not we know what beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty is or is not but inspirational\cb1 \
\cb3 has always been like well what does that\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm defining it right now all of these\cb1 \
\cb3 things\cb1 \
\cb3 inspire every one of these things\cb1 \
\cb3 inspires\cb1 \
\cb3 and last she's loyal and liberating\cb1 \
\cb3 loyal meaning\cb1 \
\cb3 when she's with you she's with you\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have to worry about whether\cb1 \
\cb3 telling her something\cb1 \
\cb3 she's got your back for real for real\cb1 \
\cb3 you can jump out of the plane and she\cb1 \
\cb3 will pull\cb1 \
\cb3 the rip cord on the parachute\cb1 \
\cb3 loyalty something that is gone from so\cb1 \
\cb3 many women today because you're so\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in it for self loyal\cb1 \
\cb3 again you can learn a lot from that\cb1 \
\cb3 man's best friend\cb1 \
\cb3 dogs why do men love dogs because\cb1 \
\cb3 they're loyal\cb1 \
\cb3 they're loyal because when a woman is\cb1 \
\cb3 loyal\cb1 \
\cb3 it liberates a man to be free to go take\cb1 \
\cb3 chances and risks because home\cb1 \
\cb3 his he doesn't have time to wonder am i\cb1 \
\cb3 come back home is she going to be here\cb1 \
\cb3 what kind of mood is she going to be in\cb1 \
\cb3 if a man has to continue to\cb1 \
\cb3 if if coming home requires more mental\cb1 \
\cb3 energy\cb1 \
\cb3 than hunting the dinosaurs or the\cb1 \
\cb3 or the the the sharks or the lions\cb1 \
\cb3 he needs to leave that home he needs to\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to walk away from that house\cb1 \
\cb3 with a clear mind\cb1 \
\cb3 to go out and compete win lead like you\cb1 \
\cb3 want him to\cb1 \
\cb3 loyal and liberating\cb1 \
\cb3 a high-value woman frees her man's mind\cb1 \
\cb3 up to win\cb1 \
\cb3 she frees his spirit up to know that\cb1 \
\cb3 home is taken care of\cb1 \
\cb3 this is yours remember when i said\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies give up your social media you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to give a man that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 liberation you don't want to free him\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to give him that that\cb1 \
\cb3 amount of comfort\cb1 \
\cb3 to say uh uh when i'm with you i'm with\cb1 \
\cb3 you nobody's going to be sliding in no\cb1 \
\cb3 instagram or facebook or\cb1 \
\cb3 no dms what's a dm she's even changing\cb1 \
\cb3 her number when she gets at you\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to see a woman who's really\cb1 \
\cb3 committed see if she'll change her\cb1 \
\cb3 number\cb1 \
\cb3 should she shut her social media down\cb1 \
\cb3 and when she change her number or\cb1 \
\cb3 is she still out here saying she's with\cb1 \
\cb3 you but looking single online\cb1 \
\cb3 this is where a lot of you women screw\cb1 \
\cb3 up\cb1 \
\cb3 lean in a lot of you women screw\cb1 \
\cb3 up because you won't\cb1 \
\cb3 liberate yourself you're still holding\cb1 \
\cb3 on so tight to your singlehood\cb1 \
\cb3 your singleness and you got a good man\cb1 \
\cb3 or man who\cb1 \
\cb3 he's everything you want but you're\cb1 \
\cb3 still out here moving on these social\cb1 \
\cb3 media streets\cb1 \
\cb3 like you're single and then you wonder\cb1 \
\cb3 why you can't get what you want because\cb1 \
\cb3 the world\cb1 \
\cb3 the universe is going to conspire to\cb1 \
\cb3 give you well\cb1 \
\cb3 you got one man and you didn't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 act right you think it's going to give\cb1 \
\cb3 you another one\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yeah i could teach class on this\cb1 \
\cb3 loyal and liberating if you've ever seen\cb1 \
\cb3 a man\cb1 \
\cb3 who has a woman who's loyal he walks a\cb1 \
\cb3 different way\cb1 \
\cb3 he knows he come back home he don't he\cb1 \
\cb3 knows we come back home\cb1 \
\cb3 that he doesn't have to dna test his\cb1 \
\cb3 kids\cb1 \
\cb3 and if he did decide to dna test his\cb1 \
\cb3 kids she wouldn't trip\cb1 \
\cb3 if there's a break in the pattern of\cb1 \
\cb3 communication she's off her pattern\cb1 \
\cb3 he doesn't have to start asking 511\cb1 \
\cb3 million questions to be coming in\cb1 \
\cb3 inspect the clue so because she's like\cb1 \
\cb3 oh what\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yeah here of course\cb1 \
\cb3 see these characteristics traits\cb1 \
\cb3 make a woman high value\cb1 \
\cb3 she is a feminine asset to everyone\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman like this is an asset to anyone\cb1 \
\cb3 in her life she's an asset to her\cb1 \
\cb3 friends\cb1 \
\cb3 her family her community her city\cb1 \
\cb3 her state the world men pets\cb1 \
\cb3 insects i don't care she's an asset\cb1 \
\cb3 now the question is ladies are you a\cb1 \
\cb3 fitbit asset\cb1 \
\cb3 see when i ask you what do you bring to\cb1 \
\cb3 the table if you're an asset you\cb1 \
\cb3 shouldn't have any real problem\cb1 \
\cb3 laying out your qualifications but if\cb1 \
\cb3 it's just your phd i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 in your body\cb1 \
\cb3 great are you a feminine\cb1 \
\cb3 asset\cb1 \
\cb3 now i'm quite sure this freaked a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all out because you probably thought\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to get a bunch of\cb1 \
\cb3 superficial height weight dress size\cb1 \
\cb3 hair texture wig weave\cb1 \
\cb3 sex positions no no\cb1 \
\cb3 just like i did with high value men i\cb1 \
\cb3 took a cross section and said\cb1 \
\cb3 across history\cb1 \
\cb3 women who have separated themselves from\cb1 \
\cb3 the pack\cb1 \
\cb3 what have made women women higher value\cb1 \
\cb3 an asset a feminine asset\cb1 \
\cb3 is worth dying for\cb1 \
\cb3 a feminine asset\cb1 \
\cb3 let me back that one up\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want to go that far scratch grab\cb1 \
\cb3 scratch scratch\cb1 \
\cb3 a feminine asset is worth acquiring\cb1 \
\cb3 see a lot of you ladies want men to\cb1 \
\cb3 chase you\cb1 \
\cb3 or pursue you an asset never has to\cb1 \
\cb3 worry about\cb1 \
\cb3 attention someone's always trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 acquire if you're if you're if something\cb1 \
\cb3 is an\cb1 \
\cb3 asset its value is understood\cb1 \
\cb3 known thus it will be acquired\cb1 \
\cb3 blue chip stocks their ass their their\cb1 \
\cb3 their values are already known penny\cb1 \
\cb3 stocks\cb1 \
\cb3 no one's in a rush to buy penny stocks\cb1 \
\cb3 what kind of woman are you are you a\cb1 \
\cb3 blue chip stock are you preferred stock\cb1 \
\cb3 do you even know what i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 a feminine asset and the choice\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is a choice that all you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 can make you can choose to become a\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine asset\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not born a feminine asset\cb1 \
\cb3 just like a man is not born high value\cb1 \
\cb3 you be you make yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 high value\cb1 \
\cb3 there are some there are some drop dead\cb1 \
\cb3 gorgeous women\cb1 \
\cb3 that are not high value\cb1 \
\cb3 just like there can be men who have a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot of money that's a lot of soot\cb1 \
\cb3 who are not high value i'll fix that\cb1 \
\cb3 later the way you fix that is you\cb1 \
\cb3 actually have to go get a tissue and\cb1 \
\cb3 clean the soot off the wick i don't like\cb1 \
\cb3 all that crap in here\cb1 \
\cb3 so here's what i'm going to do i'm going\cb1 \
\cb3 to open it up\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to open it up for questions\cb1 \
\cb3 because i want to hear from the ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you think\cb1 \
\cb3 because i've looked at other pla people\cb1 \
\cb3 and other things where people were\cb1 \
\cb3 saying this is high value that's high\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 and i saw some things that were kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 interesting\cb1 \
\cb3 very incomplete uh and many of them were\cb1 \
\cb3 written\cb1 \
\cb3 to i feel like make most women feel as\cb1 \
\cb3 though they were high value\cb1 \
\cb3 um i've heard some she's feminine she\cb1 \
\cb3 takes care of her appearance\cb1 \
\cb3 and doesn't hide it i agree um\cb1 \
\cb3 she takes care of her health she cares\cb1 \
\cb3 about people\cb1 \
\cb3 cares about her partner emotionally\cb1 \
\cb3 stable\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 she has good you know emotionally stable\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning she has good control of her\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional states\cb1 \
\cb3 uh she's socially skilled\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 she plays little games\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't yeah high-value women don't\cb1 \
\cb3 play games let me\cb1 \
\cb3 that's something i will say is good i\cb1 \
\cb3 was reading this because i saw some\cb1 \
\cb3 things that i liked but i don't like\cb1 \
\cb3 but i think it's just too too basic\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value women don't play games\cb1 \
\cb3 because they have good judgment\cb1 \
\cb3 being discerning you realize like the\cb1 \
\cb3 three-date rule and all the other kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 and when i finally explained it to women\cb1 \
\cb3 they realized how the three-date rule\cb1 \
\cb3 hurts women because you're ultimately\cb1 \
\cb3 playing\cb1 \
\cb3 games if you if you agree with\cb1 \
\cb3 not going out with a man you're not uh\cb1 \
\cb3 attracted to\cb1 \
\cb3 the first time and then off the second\cb1 \
\cb3 time don't go out with him if you would\cb1 \
\cb3 not have sex with him\cb1 \
\cb3 um knows how to set boundaries\cb1 \
\cb3 emotionally intelligent\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a growth mindset okay yeah see\cb1 \
\cb3 that's too basic but i like\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean that's some that's some decent\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff so here's the thing we're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 open it up\cb1 \
\cb3 because here's the thing ladies are you\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 do you want to be a high value woman i\cb1 \
\cb3 would say this high value women are in\cb1 \
\cb3 demand\cb1 \
\cb3 they are in demand they are in demand\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 like i said off the rip they are they\cb1 \
\cb3 are attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 make no mistake there is an attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 component\cb1 \
\cb3 but um attraction\cb1 \
\cb3 is different than just outright beauty\cb1 \
\cb3 attraction can be i'll go down as low as\cb1 \
\cb3 six that's cute\cb1 \
\cb3 especially if you're an adjustable six\cb1 \
\cb3 cute that can dress yourself up to\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 see the nose pro most of you probably\cb1 \
\cb3 thought a high value woman had to be\cb1 \
\cb3 very very attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 that would be like saying a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 man must be really really rich\cb1 \
\cb3 and no no it's there but it's not it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not it's not the only thing\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive and appealing the appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 part is\cb1 \
\cb3 the undergirding of the attraction if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 and unappealing it doesn't matter\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so back to meeting here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 this is what we're going to do we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to open it up i want to hear what\cb1 \
\cb3 the ladies have to say remember\cb1 \
\cb3 uh keep your your background noise down\cb1 \
\cb3 we're gonna get into this thing yay\cb1 \
\cb3 because i know there's some women out\cb1 \
\cb3 there probably like what in the hell\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought i was high\cb1 \

\cb3 i i would gather a lot of you probably\cb1 \
\cb3 are surprised that\cb1 \
\cb3 being drop dead gorgeous\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't make you high value\cb1 \
\cb3 and i want you to think about some of\cb1 \
\cb3 the most beautiful women you have known\cb1 \
\cb3 who may have been movie stars or or\cb1 \
\cb3 public personalities\cb1 \
\cb3 who were very\cb1 \
\cb3 who how valuable were they to their men\cb1 \

\cb3 and hip-hop or something like that\cb1 \
\cb3 housewives or whatever she was on one of\cb1 \
\cb3 those shows\cb1 \

\cb3 because the way i am is\cb1 \
\cb3 that i'm very much enthusiastic when i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 in a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm very much like a dog and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 just like obsessed with my man\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm not like that when i'm single\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not like that too i'm not like that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm totally just\cb1 \
\cb3 chill and you know kind of in my own\cb1 \
\cb3 world so i don't know if that's\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah it's important i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 um see a lot of you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you saving yourself what's like\cb1 \
\cb3 well when i'm with my man i'm this but\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you get to be his woman\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i mean you ladies are like i would\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is one of the things that as\cb1 \
\cb3 far as off with so many modern women\cb1 \
\cb3 today\cb1 \
\cb3 you want men to give all these things up\cb1 \
\cb3 front and then you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 wait until a relationship happens\cb1 \
\cb3 so i got to approach you ask you out\cb1 \
\cb3 take you out spend money\cb1 \
\cb3 three to six dates before we even\cb1 \
\cb3 possibly have sex and then continue\cb1 \
\cb3 to do this over and over and over and\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over again and then maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 six months into it 18 dates later you're\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna finally decide to\cb1 \
\cb3 no that's so i don't know i can't i\cb1 \
\cb3 can't speak for other women but that's\cb1 \
\cb3 not how it is for me so for me\cb1 \
\cb3 personally\cb1 \
\cb3 um it's not that i'm withholding it's\cb1 \
\cb3 just more so that i'm just\cb1 \
\cb3 that's just naturally the way i am well\cb1 \
\cb3 then how do you get the job dude dear\cb1 \
\cb3 if you you you have a job yeah i have a\cb1 \
\cb3 job yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 right so when you went to an interview\cb1 \
\cb3 for the job they they have more than one\cb1 \
\cb3 applicant right\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah that is true did you wait to say\cb1 \
\cb3 would you want to hire me and i'll tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you what i will be the best\cb1 \
\cb3 no i did not do that now no and exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're hiring and you're in the job\cb1 \
\cb3 i have is my last name\cb1 \
\cb3 my wedding ring and my commitment see\cb1 \
\cb3 more you ladies need to start acting\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 you're let's be real most of you feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 you're entitled to a man and we got to\cb1 \
\cb3 do tricks to get you because\cb1 \
\cb3 you have sex\cb1 \
\cb3 no i don't think that i said most of you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay okay true is that not the dating\cb1 \
\cb3 world\cb1 \
\cb3 do you see women really really trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm old enough to remember a world where\cb1 \
\cb3 women actually used to make themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive and appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 and actually used to you know let guys\cb1 \
\cb3 know they were interested and\cb1 \
\cb3 women actually called guys wrote guys\cb1 \
\cb3 letters i mean did things\cb1 \
\cb3 weren't just sitting around waiting for\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody because here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're a decent looking woman you've\cb1 \
\cb3 got\cb1 \
\cb3 a hundred times a thousand times more\cb1 \
\cb3 men talking to you than any other time\cb1 \
\cb3 before\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's human nature to get kind of lazy\cb1 \
\cb3 that is true but i actually just i\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to speak on that i think the part\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 i think what actually um\cb1 \
\cb3 makes men kind of like i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 disappointed in me or something like\cb1 \
\cb3 that is actually my discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 actually the fact that i am so\cb1 \
\cb3 disciplined like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 25. so disciplined in what\cb1 \
\cb3 when it comes to fitness and eating and\cb1 \
\cb3 dieting i am extremely\cb1 \
\cb3 uh i'm extremely strict about what i eat\cb1 \
\cb3 what i allow in my body\cb1 \
\cb3 but i think sometimes because i'm thin i\cb1 \
\cb3 think\cb1 \
\cb3 men well not i think i've been told\cb1 \
\cb3 they're like oh i think you're anorexic\cb1 \
\cb3 like you don't match my lifestyle oh you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to go out here because\cb1 \
\cb3 you know you're not going to eat\cb1 \
\cb3 anything and it's like i try to be like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll go all right hold\cb1 \
\cb3 uh a year ago how long did it last\cb1 \
\cb3 two years and you guys aren't together\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 uh when college ended um\cb1 \
\cb3 he decided to move on so yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 that didn't tell me anything so so\cb1 \
\cb3 um college ended um we we both got the\cb1 \
\cb3 same degree\cb1 \
\cb3 um he decided to get um he took a job\cb1 \
\cb3 in california i took a job in\cb1 \
\cb3 washington um but i told him that i\cb1 \
\cb3 would have moved for him he told me he\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't want me to he said\cb1 \
\cb3 he think it's best for us to just go our\cb1 \
\cb3 separate ways because he wanted to do\cb1 \
\cb3 his own thing so have you ever asked him\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i did and he pretty much said that\cb1 \
\cb3 he didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 at the at that time he changed his mind\cb1 \
\cb3 about wanting a long-term relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty much that's what he said with you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh no he well he said in general\cb1 \
\cb3 but maybe he didn't meet with me\cb1 \
\cb3 okay as long as you asked him why okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 look i hear what you're saying but if\cb1 \
\cb3 you had a two-year relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you got to get out here and one\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't you're not dating you got to\cb1 \
\cb3 have more dates\cb1 \
\cb3 number one yeah yeah you're right um so\cb1 \
\cb3 you're saying men are this way\cb1 \
\cb3 that way i i i i can't really go unless\cb1 \
\cb3 you're really out there\cb1 \
\cb3 the net net of it is what are you\cb1 \
\cb3 waiting for\cb1 \
\cb3 um you said you're exuberant when a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship happens\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you actively pursuing how are\cb1 \
\cb3 you actively setting yourself up to be\cb1 \
\cb3 pursued by the kind of men that you\cb1 \
\cb3 think that you want well what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 currently doing is that i\cb1 \
\cb3 um i am using dating sites because you\cb1 \
\cb3 know coronas\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not really you know out here and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to be honest even before i was\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of more of a homebody anyways\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm not the answer is no you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 you've never been on a few days yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not you're not you're not you're\cb1 \
\cb3 right yeah you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not so the problem is not the\cb1 \
\cb3 you hear that yeah that's your\cb1 \
\cb3 biological clock ticking\cb1 \
\cb3 and your time um\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem isn't that you're over the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 you are you're not active\cb1 \
\cb3 you're passive in this situation\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you're going to be passive you\cb1 \
\cb3 hear this is conduct\cb1 \
\cb3 that's at your clock and every year\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a newer model\cb1 \
\cb3 and the reason you could be passive is\cb1 \
\cb3 because you have a vagina and you think\cb1 \
\cb3 it's gonna come to you and it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 no that's not true i think the reason\cb1 \
\cb3 why i have been passive is because on\cb1 \
\cb3 the few dates that i have went on\cb1 \
\cb3 i've just been i felt like i've just\cb1 \
\cb3 been judged\cb1 \
\cb3 based on okay have you ever played new\cb1 \
\cb3 sports\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yes i have i always ran i was a\cb1 \
\cb3 runner\cb1 \
\cb3 right all right did you win it look man\cb1 \
\cb3 you've had a you ladies kill me your\cb1 \
\cb3 tolerance for rejection today is like\cb1 \
\cb3 trash you realize how much rejection\cb1 \
\cb3 and and turn down you're supposed to get\cb1 \
\cb3 before you actually find somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 yes you've been on a couple yeah you've\cb1 \
\cb3 been on a couple of dates i\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care okay look i get it\cb1 \
\cb3 but what's the solution you're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 just sit in the house\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm trying to work on myself so i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to i am trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 have a better relationship with food\cb1 \
\cb3 well i've been going to a therapist for\cb1 \
\cb3 a year but i'm trying to have a better\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship with food\cb1 \
\cb3 and i guess um i think i need to present\cb1 \
\cb3 myself better so it doesn't seem like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 dieting because i think that's how i\cb1 \
\cb3 come across was this your picture\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah how recent is this uh\cb1 \
\cb3 that's like three months ago is this\cb1 \
\cb3 your current hair color\cb1 \
\cb3 no that was temporary just for\cb1 \
\cb3 a costume i was doing yeah all right\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 well yeah um social skills\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional intelligence is very critical\cb1 \
\cb3 how about women have great social skills\cb1 \
\cb3 and uh\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not going to make this about you but\cb1 \
\cb3 far too many women today\cb1 \
\cb3 are weirdos a lot of you ladies are\cb1 \
\cb3 freaking weirdos\cb1 \
\cb3 especially ones who have low social\cb1 \
\cb3 skills and not a lot of history in\cb1 \
\cb3 dating\cb1 \
\cb3 you have phds and masters and everything\cb1 \
\cb3 else and you're a bunch of freaking\cb1 \
\cb3 weirdos nobody can talk to you\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's like you forgot how to be women\cb1 \
\cb3 huh i said so i'm not gonna make that\cb1 \
\cb3 about you but\cb1 \
\cb3 it's this really should be this\cb1 \
\cb3 complicated attractive and appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 comforting and have character\cb1 \
\cb3 disciplined and discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 enthusiastic and exuberant loyal and\cb1 \
\cb3 liberating\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty simple pretty simple\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't say you had to be this tall\cb1 \
\cb3 look like this have these grooves\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah but but but apparently it's not so\cb1 \
\cb3 simple because these things are high\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 or pretty direct i will say they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 simple what's going on doc\cb1 \
\cb3 what's up guys all right what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 hi so i wanted to highlight something\cb1 \
\cb3 and then\cb1 \
\cb3 see what you think because it's one\cb1 \
\cb3 thing i've had to learn the hard way\cb1 \
\cb3 grace hold on hold on uh casey swirler\cb1 \
\cb3 you can call back i know you got\cb1 \
\cb3 something you want to say yes grace\cb1 \
\cb3 needs to be in there but i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 leave that as a wild card\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you know why i left it as a wild\cb1 \
\cb3 card\cb1 \
\cb3 why um because\cb1 \
\cb3 men like myself care about a modicum of\cb1 \
\cb3 grace\cb1 \
\cb3 but if i have to be honest\cb1 \
\cb3 cross-culturally\cb1 \
\cb3 some guys like their women to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit more um\cb1 \
\cb3 how about less grace so i'm trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm trying not to i try not to get too\cb1 \
\cb3 far into my i tried i had to try to\cb1 \
\cb3 detach myself from it\cb1 \
\cb3 but i think grace needs to be in there\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i put in\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the part about character and\cb1 \
\cb3 discernment\cb1 \
\cb3 uh that was as close to grace as i could\cb1 \
\cb3 put in there without making it\cb1 \
\cb3 too lopsided but go ahead my definition\cb1 \
\cb3 of grace is\cb1 \
\cb3 more like not giving people what they\cb1 \
\cb3 deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 all the time that would be the i would\cb1 \
\cb3 define great grace\cb1 \
\cb3 in just in general it means you see\cb1 \
\cb3 someone fail and you give them the\cb1 \
\cb3 benefit of the doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 right because the men that i know that\cb1 \
\cb3 are really high value they\cb1 \
\cb3 um they take a lot of risk and they do\cb1 \
\cb3 fail\cb1 \
\cb3 quite a bit that's why when i said\cb1 \
\cb3 discerning\cb1 \
\cb3 she has good judgment to know how to be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to give him the benefit of doubting\cb1 \
\cb3 that liberating thing\cb1 \
\cb3 see one of the one of the if i could\cb1 \
\cb3 show you my decision tree\cb1 \
\cb3 uh in the decision tree risk for\cb1 \
\cb3 tolerance was\cb1 \
\cb3 high in these things because her talent\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna have to be able to step on\cb1 \
\cb3 this boat with me\cb1 \
\cb3 that i just knitted together with leaves\cb1 \
\cb3 and and trust that i'm gonna get us\cb1 \
\cb3 across and not kill us\cb1 \
\cb3 because we do take risks um\cb1 \
\cb3 and yes grace to let men fail is\cb1 \
\cb3 is key um but i didn't want to put it in\cb1 \
\cb3 grace because i think it would have been\cb1 \
\cb3 miscarriage\cb1 \
\cb3 i know how youtube works and more people\cb1 \
\cb3 were just our grace and looked\cb1 \
\cb3 misunderstood i still i think i think\cb1 \
\cb3 it'll be misunderstood but\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead understand i have a story for\cb1 \
\cb3 that go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 so one time we were going to amsterdam\cb1 \
\cb3 and his husband's dream and he kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 led that trip so\cb1 \
\cb3 he said i'm going to get everything\cb1 \
\cb3 together and something inside me that\cb1 \
\cb3 morning said something is going to\cb1 \
\cb3 happen really bad\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like a woman he grabbed the\cb1 \
\cb3 passports i even said you got the\cb1 \
\cb3 passports right he's like yeah i got the\cb1 \
\cb3 passports\cb1 \
\cb3 we got to the airport and he got his\cb1 \
\cb3 passport and my\cb1 \
\cb3 expired passport\cb1 \
\cb3 so you know typical reaction would have\cb1 \
\cb3 been oh my god i knew you're gonna do\cb1 \
\cb3 something i had a feeling\cb1 \
\cb3 you were gonna screw up i knew i should\cb1 \
\cb3 have done it myself i just have to do\cb1 \
\cb3 everything myself right\cb1 \
\cb3 but something inside me said well it's\cb1 \
\cb3 an honest mistake i said don't worry\cb1 \
\cb3 about it\cb1 \
\cb3 we'll go tomorrow we'll spend six days\cb1 \
\cb3 there instead of seven it's not a big\cb1 \
\cb3 deal\cb1 \
\cb3 um i think he felt worse because i\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't give him a hard time about it\cb1 \
\cb3 i actually still had work to do so i\cb1 \
\cb3 pulled up my laptop and i was\cb1 \
\cb3 signing things while we waited for my\cb1 \
\cb3 mom to maybe bring my passport down\cb1 \
\cb3 in the meantime the ticketing agent came\cb1 \
\cb3 by and said hey guys you know\cb1 \
\cb3 if you were first class we could um\cb1 \
\cb3 escort you through security and that\cb1 \
\cb3 might buy you some time\cb1 \
\cb3 and he was like how much four grand\cb1 \
\cb3 extra which is actually cheap for that\cb1 \
\cb3 flight\cb1 \
\cb3 and my mom got there with plenty of time\cb1 \
\cb3 we didn't even really need the extra\cb1 \
\cb3 time\cb1 \
\cb3 but i think sorry go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 i think if you're the kind of woman that\cb1 \
\cb3 like jumps to correct somebody and can't\cb1 \
\cb3 wait to put someone in their place\cb1 \
\cb3 uh-oh some people go they can go economy\cb1 \
\cb3 okay those girls don't go first class if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're very willing to give your man the\cb1 \
\cb3 benefit of the doubt\cb1 \
\cb3 then you'd be surprised ladies how how\cb1 \
\cb3 they can\cb1 \
\cb3 um self-correct better than you could\cb1 \
\cb3 ever correct\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the things you'll notice on my\cb1 \
\cb3 show is oftentimes\cb1 \
\cb3 i will allow enough rope to see how\cb1 \
\cb3 someone's going to respond\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's really what it comes down to\cb1 \
\cb3 are you going to\cb1 \
\cb3 lose the point the other day i was\cb1 \
\cb3 talking to a woman who was that\cb1 \
\cb3 the 26 year old virgin\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's why i said you lost the plot\cb1 \
\cb3 the plot is not about fornication the\cb1 \
\cb3 plot is about\cb1 \
\cb3 the forest for the trees but you have to\cb1 \
\cb3 be right so much\cb1 \
\cb3 you win the argument you lose the man\cb1 \
\cb3 which is tomorrow night's show\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies tune in lose because she\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the sign shame insults guilt and\cb1 \
\cb3 the need to be right this happens\cb1 \
\cb3 so often so what you your story\cb1 \
\cb3 allows men a room to make a mistake and\cb1 \
\cb3 you make the best of a bad situation\cb1 \
\cb3 and it turns out better and he'd still\cb1 \
\cb3 be your hero he can fail\cb1 \
\cb3 and still be your hero\cb1 \
\cb3 and and by not\cb1 \
\cb3 jumping on him he didn't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 that liberated and liberated him from\cb1 \
\cb3 that guilt\cb1 \
\cb3 and he was like well damn i got a good\cb1 \
\cb3 one here let me see how i can make this\cb1 \
\cb3 happen because she could really read me\cb1 \
\cb3 because that was messed up that's all we\cb1 \
\cb3 really want is\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't want you to be our moms we want\cb1 \
\cb3 you to be you know we want to be the\cb1 \
\cb3 superhero to you guys but you got to let\cb1 \
\cb3 us\cb1 \
\cb3 save you or fix stuff and sometimes the\cb1 \
\cb3 best thing you can do is just say\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you got it yeah okay no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's some [ __ ] you can go brag to\cb1 \
\cb3 your boys about they'd be like what\cb1 \
\cb3 she did what she didn't jump on you man\cb1 \
\cb3 no oh damn\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it doc no problem good job\cb1 \
\cb3 bye-bye tomorrow night's show is losing\cb1 \
\cb3 winning\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how how how women you lose ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 by trying to win too much okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so uh casey my my\cb1 \
\cb3 um swirl friend she called in again i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know what what it is but\cb1 \
\cb3 all right grace\cb1 \
\cb3 uh did you guys understand the forgiving\cb1 \
\cb3 spirit\cb1 \
\cb3 and the thing is more more than anything\cb1 \
\cb3 else is\cb1 \
\cb3 men especially if you have an ambitious\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i talk about cia has many\cb1 \
\cb3 levels confident intelligence surgery\cb1 \
\cb3 that's one level\cb1 \
\cb3 the next level competitive intriguing\cb1 \
\cb3 and aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 okay that's the guys who are like in\cb1 \
\cb3 middle management things like that guys\cb1 \
\cb3 who are moving up the ladder\cb1 \
\cb3 but when you start getting guys who are\cb1 \
\cb3 the back bold ambitious\cb1 \
\cb3 and generous ambition breaks\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff and many of you women\cb1 \
\cb3 want men who have ambitious outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't like the process let me\cb1 \
\cb3 explain\cb1 \
\cb3 you want a third you want to be married\cb1 \
\cb3 to a man who can put you in a home\cb1 \
\cb3 in buckhead and buy you a porsche truck\cb1 \
\cb3 or lan\cb1 \
\cb3 a range rover or whatever have three\cb1 \
\cb3 kids that can have a solid middle class\cb1 \
\cb3 a lower upper class life\cb1 \
\cb3 you never have to work or die a drop\cb1 \
\cb3 outside the home\cb1 \
\cb3 after you're pregnant with the first kid\cb1 \
\cb3 well that's 300 plus\cb1 \
\cb3 thousand dollars a man is going to need\cb1 \
\cb3 to make\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to show up after the money's\cb1 \
\cb3 already there\cb1 \
\cb3 and what men would love to have is a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who's there\cb1 \
\cb3 in process that's it's the environment's\cb1 \
\cb3 changed so the thing is ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're going to come at the end where\cb1 \
\cb3 the outcomes are there\cb1 \
\cb3 um you can't just bring the same thing\cb1 \
\cb3 that you would have brought\cb1 \
\cb3 at the beginning of the process now ah\cb1 \
\cb3 jesus go ahead\cb1 \

\cb3 comes to\cb1 \
\cb3 dark-skinned black men in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not doing that\cb1 \

\cb3 follow my rules i agree to\cb1 \
\cb3 follow your rules yes thank you so\cb1 \
\cb3 going from here on out you don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about this topic at all is what\cb1 \
\cb3 you're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 no no see what i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 is traits of being a high-value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and nowhere\cb1 \
\cb3 in my entire monologue did i mention\cb1 \
\cb3 race nor did i mention skin tone\cb1 \
\cb3 neither did even neither the previous\cb1 \
\cb3 two\cb1 \
\cb3 callers so due respect\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not the topic\cb1 \
\cb3 i understand that it's just been\cb1 \
\cb3 something that's been very\cb1 \
\cb3 prominent in my i don't care about\cb1 \
\cb3 what's been prominent\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is not the casey show if it's\cb1 \
\cb3 been prominent in your life\cb1 \
\cb3 you have an entire channel go make it\cb1 \
\cb3 about that\cb1 \
\cb3 this is what i said the lack of respect\cb1 \
\cb3 i've already said what the show was\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 and you come over here trying to make it\cb1 \
\cb3 about what you want to talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 it's disrespectful okay kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 well i mean would you or did you did you\cb1 \
\cb3 go to college\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i actually graduated congratulations\cb1 \
\cb3 would you walk into a political science\cb1 \
\cb3 class\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about physics because you had\cb1 \
\cb3 physics on the mind\cb1 \
\cb3 no but those are two unrelated topics no\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not really\cb1 \
\cb3 i asked it's still college it's bottom\cb1 \
\cb3 line is one class is on something\cb1 \
\cb3 this is on another or when the\cb1 \
\cb3 professor's speaking on his subject\cb1 \
\cb3 would you go in and try to change the\cb1 \
\cb3 subject to talk about what you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 see i think the more interesting thing\cb1 \
\cb3 casey is why do you continue to come\cb1 \
\cb3 back\cb1 \
\cb3 over here you're an advocate for black\cb1 \
\cb3 women dating out but you continue to\cb1 \
\cb3 come\cb1 \
\cb3 over here is it not interesting enough\cb1 \
\cb3 where you're at\cb1 \
\cb3 i watch your channel because i like to\cb1 \
\cb3 learn\cb1 \
\cb3 i like the information that you give you\cb1 \
\cb3 know i use the skills that you provide\cb1 \
\cb3 women to find a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 but you already have a boyfriend you\cb1 \
\cb3 have a you have a white\cb1 \
\cb3 boyfriend right and he's on the younger\cb1 \
\cb3 side so he's not\cb1 \
\cb3 making six figures though i have been\cb1 \
\cb3 asked on multiple days from\cb1 \
\cb3 men who are in that category they were\cb1 \
\cb3 just like\cb1 \
\cb3 40. so i chose not to afford um they\cb1 \
\cb3 were what\cb1 \
\cb3 but i used the tools they were they were\cb1 \
\cb3 what\cb1 \
\cb3 40 40 35 to\cb1 \
\cb3 early 40s well that was a bit too old\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 i was gonna be honest listen then why do\cb1 \
\cb3 you need a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 get a regular guy every girl\cb1 \
\cb3 should have a high value man then every\cb1 \
\cb3 girl would not have a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 that makes no sense that's\cb1 \
\cb3 mathematically impossible\cb1 \
\cb3 if every girl had a high value man there\cb1 \
\cb3 would be no high value men because\cb1 \
\cb3 every man would be the same thus none\cb1 \
\cb3 would be higher value\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so what is your advice for getting\cb1 \
\cb3 a high value man in here well\cb1 \
\cb3 here's what i was one thing i would\cb1 \
\cb3 suggest stop being\cb1 \
\cb3 one there's something going on\cb1 \
\cb3 in your spirit at 22 years old to be\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 disagreeable\cb1 \
\cb3 okay why do you say i'm disagreeable uh\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's not i said i'm just saying at\cb1 \
\cb3 22 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a lot of issues that if you\cb1 \
\cb3 really having issues\cb1 \
\cb3 i would go seek professional therapy\cb1 \
\cb3 youtube is not the place\cb1 \
\cb3 to suss out these\cb1 \
\cb3 color issues\cb1 \
\cb3 uh this isn't the place for that if you\cb1 \
\cb3 really want to do improvement\cb1 \
\cb3 that's one-on-one with an actual\cb1 \
\cb3 professional counselor you got to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 for that\cb1 \
\cb3 but i said it's a disagreeable nature\cb1 \
\cb3 because talking to you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's been a disagreeable experience but\cb1 \
\cb3 i can handle it\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just saying if i met you in public\cb1 \
\cb3 and you were this way i would not even\cb1 \
\cb3 i would that would be no further\cb1 \
\cb3 interaction but back to the point of why\cb1 \
\cb3 do you need a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 what makes you why do you need a man\cb1 \
\cb3 that makes that kind of money\cb1 \
\cb3 i need a man that makes that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 money because i've been around\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of upper cl a lot of upper middle\cb1 \
\cb3 class kids and a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 rich kids and i see the kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 lifestyles they have\cb1 \
\cb3 i see you know the kind of lifestyles\cb1 \
\cb3 their parents have provided them with\cb1 \
\cb3 better schools\cb1 \
\cb3 are your parents or were your parents uh\cb1 \
\cb3 upper middle class\cb1 \
\cb3 that's another thing my mom actually out\cb1 \
\cb3 earned my dad\cb1 \
\cb3 and they did make he said i said your\cb1 \
\cb3 hair i\cb1 \
\cb3 said see active listening i said your\cb1 \
\cb3 parents and you went to your mother and\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 and that she made more i didn't make the\cb1 \
\cb3 distinction\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i'm sorry well yes that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 disagreeable nature you have\cb1 \
\cb3 always looking for the distinction to\cb1 \
\cb3 correct someone\cb1 \
\cb3 or to make an issue where there is none\cb1 \
\cb3 i clearly said\cb1 \
\cb3 were your parents upper middle class you\cb1 \
\cb3 found an issue no that's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the issue\cb1 \
\cb3 my mother made more than my father that\cb1 \
\cb3 was you\cb1 \
\cb3 not me okay i i see\cb1 \
\cb3 well my parents made six figures okay\cb1 \
\cb3 your parents made six figures what is\cb1 \
\cb3 your degree in\cb1 \
\cb3 my degree is in biology\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and what did you plan on doing with\cb1 \
\cb3 that degree in biology\cb1 \
\cb3 i am planning on going to med school\cb1 \
\cb3 and pursuing what\cb1 \
\cb3 i would like to be a primary care\cb1 \
\cb3 physician\cb1 \
\cb3 okay primary care not general medicine\cb1 \
\cb3 yes not enough actually pediatric action\cb1 \
\cb3 pediatrics all right\cb1 \
\cb3 so after you're married\cb1 \
\cb3 and you get pregnant with your first\cb1 \
\cb3 child do you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to have to continue to work to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 significant bills\cb1 \
\cb3 yes and i would like to work part-time\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would also like to have a nanny\cb1 \
\cb3 right so again\cb1 \
\cb3 part-time yes and what percentage\cb1 \
\cb3 of the bills do you think your income\cb1 \
\cb3 should support\cb1 \
\cb3 for the entire family zero\cb1 \
\cb3 right so you don't want to have to work\cb1 \
\cb3 to pay significant bills\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want your income to cover\cb1 \
\cb3 anything\cb1 \
\cb3 so let's get on to the next thing you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to go to school acquire\cb1 \
\cb3 all this debt at the end of the day you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to have to carry\cb1 \
\cb3 any of the financial load fine my\cb1 \
\cb3 question is this\cb1 \
\cb3 who at what age do you think a man makes\cb1 \
\cb3 that kind of money\cb1 \
\cb3 legally\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say 30 early 30s\cb1 \
\cb3 what state do you live in i live in\cb1 \
\cb3 michigan\cb1 \
\cb3 and how much money were you talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about annually for three children\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say\cb1 \
\cb3 300k on the low end\cb1 \
\cb3 and what and who makes 300 000\cb1 \
\cb3 on the low end legally by age 30\cb1 \
\cb3 what professions early 30s\cb1 \
\cb3 doctors right\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so go ahead who else\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say i don't really know what\cb1 \
\cb3 other professions\cb1 \
\cb3 right so so if you're gonna you're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna whittle down\cb1 \
\cb3 this country of 300 plus 350 million\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 down to just men over 30 to doctors\cb1 \
\cb3 male doctors over 30. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i mean great great and here's the\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the okay that's fine over 30.\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the thing why would they want\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 i think that they would want me because\cb1 \
\cb3 they've already reached out to me to be\cb1 \
\cb3 completely honest\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no i asked you a simple question\cb1 \
\cb3 and see\cb1 \
\cb3 why would they want you because\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm fit i'm fun i'm flirty i'm beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 i have no children and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm agreeable\cb1 \
\cb3 [Laughter]\cb1 \
\cb3 look sweetheart let's let me go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 and cut to the chase\cb1 \
\cb3 they've reached out at you because you\cb1 \
\cb3 look nice they can't know all this other\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff so\cb1 \
\cb3 you can stop capping um\cb1 \
\cb3 in the nature and there's a big\cb1 \
\cb3 difference between wanting to date you\cb1 \
\cb3 to have sex with you and or marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 big difference\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and so i guess my next question for\cb1 \
\cb3 you is the real question no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no the thing is why should\cb1 \
\cb3 someone take you who is going to\cb1 \
\cb3 who's paying for you do you have how\cb1 \
\cb3 much is your student loan debt right now\cb1 \
\cb3 right now i'm only about\cb1 \
\cb3 30k in debt only 30k all right and then\cb1 \
\cb3 how much would medical school be\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i'm not even it'll\cb1 \
\cb3 be over six figures right isn't that so\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get this straight\cb1 \
\cb3 casey comes with 30 000 in\cb1 \
\cb3 student loan debt not including consumer\cb1 \
\cb3 and credit card debt\cb1 \
\cb3 then afterwards she's going to tackle an\cb1 \
\cb3 additional six figures\cb1 \
\cb3 in medical school debt yet this guy\cb1 \
\cb3 the doctor is supposed to pick\cb1 \
\cb3 you because you're fun flip your fun fit\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful flirty and hundreds of\cb1 \
\cb3 thousands of dollars in debt\cb1 \
\cb3 and you don't want to have to pay zero\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to pay zero percentage of the\cb1 \
\cb3 family bills\cb1 \
\cb3 and he has other women who are fun\cb1 \
\cb3 fit flirty and far less debt\cb1 \
\cb3 who are as attractive many maybe more\cb1 \
\cb3 and he should pick you why well\cb1 \
\cb3 something that i have that they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have and i know that you say that men\cb1 \
\cb3 don't care about degrees\cb1 \
\cb3 but another channel that i've watched\cb1 \
\cb3 actually said that men do like\cb1 \
\cb3 degrees excuse me your degree\cb1 \
\cb3 matters nothing if you plan on doing\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing to help the family with it\cb1 \
\cb3 you said you want to pay zero percent of\cb1 \
\cb3 the bills so do\cb1 \
\cb3 to respect you could have not even\cb1 \
\cb3 graduated high school\cb1 \
\cb3 for the effect for the outcomes we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to get from your degrees\cb1 \
\cb3 and your hundreds of thousands of\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars of debt see what i do on this\cb1 \
\cb3 show\cb1 \
\cb3 is i test and question what women like\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 want and that's fine i make no bones\cb1 \
\cb3 about what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 but i ask what do you bring to the table\cb1 \
\cb3 to get it and what it sounds to me like\cb1 \
\cb3 is your list of what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 is very long and you really have not\cb1 \
\cb3 articulated\cb1 \
\cb3 why a guy should buy it\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i feel like i listed all the\cb1 \
\cb3 reasons that you've listed what's unique\cb1 \
\cb3 to you though sweetheart that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 you're fit okay due respect i don't see\cb1 \
\cb3 your picture so i'm just going off what\cb1 \
\cb3 you say\cb1 \
\cb3 but what would you rank yourself on a\cb1 \
\cb3 scale from one to ten you cannot use\cb1 \
\cb3 seven just your face\cb1 \
\cb3 i've already given you uh i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 remember dear i've slept so\cb1 \
\cb3 here we go again i don't care i've slept\cb1 \
\cb3 we're still here\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'd give myself an adjustable\cb1 \
\cb3 six because as i said last time i would\cb1 \
\cb3 never put myself on the same scale as\cb1 \
\cb3 beyonce but i will say\cb1 \
\cb3 that people have told me that i'm very\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 okay sometimes people just randomly tell\cb1 \
\cb3 me that so that's why i think\cb1 \
\cb3 all right i think i'm pretty okay that's\cb1 \
\cb3 fine but again\cb1 \
\cb3 but i think you would be i think you'd\cb1 \
\cb3 be reasonable to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 an adjustable six is not an eight or\cb1 \
\cb3 nine so you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 winning you're not out you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 outperforming in the area of beauty\cb1 \
\cb3 where are you out per here's the\cb1 \
\cb3 question where are you outperforming\cb1 \
\cb3 the female competition i want to change\cb1 \
\cb3 that i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i'm an eight but if i put myself\cb1 \
\cb3 as an eight then beyonce needs to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 nine\cb1 \
\cb3 no beyonce is where she is because she\cb1 \
\cb3 is\cb1 \
\cb3 and we can't say seven no you can't okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so where are you outperforming the\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine the female competition\cb1 \
\cb3 i i feel like i'm more feminine\cb1 \
\cb3 especially when it comes to other\cb1 \
\cb3 unfortunately other black women a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 black women aren't as feminine today\cb1 \
\cb3 for reasons that i won't go into because\cb1 \
\cb3 you won't you don't want to talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 but i feel like i'm more feminine i'm in\cb1 \
\cb3 shape compared to a lot of other black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 but again i'm not competing with black\cb1 \
\cb3 women for the most part\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah but see here's the thing you\cb1 \
\cb3 how tall are you i am five\cb1 \
\cb3 five and how often do you wear heels\cb1 \
\cb3 i never wear heels\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're feminine i can't i have\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a medical reason why i can't i\cb1 \
\cb3 have a bunion so\cb1 \
\cb3 but i do wear dresses you wear you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a bunions\cb1 \
\cb3 i do that sounds so bad\cb1 \
\cb3 because it is you can't wear heels i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 no it's a bone that sticks out i know\cb1 \
\cb3 what a bun i know what a bunion is\cb1 \
\cb3 okay check that [ __ ] see that's what i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean you need to back that attitude up\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not your peer little girl\cb1 \
\cb3 okay that's what i that's what i said\cb1 \
\cb3 earlier\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not your [ __ ] peer\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 22 right right\cb1 \
\cb3 act like okay okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so pretty much you're told me i can have\cb1 \
\cb3 all that but if i'm not an eight or nine\cb1 \
\cb3 then what i'm telling you what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 telling you is\cb1 \
\cb3 you want a man who is earning in the top\cb1 \
\cb3 three percent in this country right\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but due respect most women\cb1 \
\cb3 want him and what are you doing to\cb1 \
\cb3 outperform\cb1 \
\cb3 the hundreds thousands of women\cb1 \
\cb3 who are trying to get him\cb1 \
\cb3 i am so how do i\cb1 \
\cb3 the men in my inbox that makes six\cb1 \
\cb3 figures that are doctors and lawyers\cb1 \
\cb3 have you seen any w-2s\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you know what they make i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 i know one guy for sure owned multiple\cb1 \
\cb3 restaurants and then\cb1 \
\cb3 see what he owns is him there's a\cb1 \
\cb3 demonstration\cb1 \
\cb3 see i i make money but what me giving it\cb1 \
\cb3 to you\cb1 \
\cb3 is it's a big difference right so you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies tend to mistake just because a\cb1 \
\cb3 man makes money like you have access to\cb1 \
\cb3 it but let's skip on to let's get down\cb1 \
\cb3 to the plot\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't like you don't you you think a\cb1 \
\cb3 man in 35 or 40 is too old\cb1 \
\cb3 so what you want is a young millionaire\cb1 \
\cb3 no not a millionaire yeah well\cb1 \
\cb3 you want a young man who's earning three\cb1 \
\cb3 hundred thousand dollars or more\cb1 \
\cb3 and they don't do that legally\cb1 \
\cb3 right so and uh so you know what that\cb1 \
\cb3 means you're gonna be right\cb1 \
\cb3 here's another one for you\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's what the rest of your life's\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna look like\cb1 \
\cb3 because this is where you're headed\cb1 \
\cb3 okay okay but how can i tell when the\cb1 \
\cb3 guys ask me out on a date how can i tell\cb1 \
\cb3 if they they actually want to date me or\cb1 \
\cb3 if they just want to say\cb1 \
\cb3 i would tell you i would tell you right\cb1 \
\cb3 now i'm not trying to be funny but\cb1 \
\cb3 talking to you what do i get\cb1 \
\cb3 i got a 22 year old with a a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 opinions\cb1 \
\cb3 and nothing substantive and i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to be rude but a 22 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 young lady's opinions\cb1 \
\cb3 are worth what i can write on the back\cb1 \
\cb3 of a stamp\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a degree in biology and an\cb1 \
\cb3 entitled attitude\cb1 \
\cb3 your father doesn't make this kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 money your mother and father together\cb1 \
\cb3 if they made this kind of money that\cb1 \
\cb3 would be saying something and you want\cb1 \
\cb3 one person to make this kind of money so\cb1 \
\cb3 he can pay\cb1 \
\cb3 all of your i just let you talk so you\cb1 \
\cb3 can go back and listen to how\cb1 \
\cb3 entitled you sound i want a biology\cb1 \
\cb3 degree and go to medical school and rack\cb1 \
\cb3 up all this and then i want somebody to\cb1 \
\cb3 come take care of me for the rest of my\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 in exchange they get the wonderful me\cb1 \
\cb3 that is casey\cb1 \
\cb3 and then i'll just biologically\cb1 \
\cb3 reproduce like any other woman\cb1 \
\cb3 on the face of the planet you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to do anything outside of that\cb1 \
\cb3 and oh by the way pay all this debt that\cb1 \
\cb3 i put on you\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not special i see what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 but when you're looking and the thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 when you come in here with this\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff that you've been coming here with\cb1 \
\cb3 these colorism and this and that i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 i get it now you are\cb1 \
\cb3 you can want what you want i don't i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't make any bones in that\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is what is he going to get\cb1 \
\cb3 from you\cb1 \
\cb3 my my youth i think that's doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 matter if you okay\cb1 \
\cb3 your youth yes\cb1 \
\cb3 who oh okay let's let's test that\cb1 \
\cb3 a man you don't want a dead man in his\cb1 \
\cb3 30s\cb1 \
\cb3 right i just changed my mind about that\cb1 \
\cb3 well but no\cb1 \
\cb3 you that you don't really you don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 him you want his money and his outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 and i learned from you that\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships are\cb1 \
\cb3 okay go ahead but the problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 if you think that a man that's up there\cb1 \
\cb3 won't be able to sniff\cb1 \
\cb3 your intentions aren't good man you\cb1 \
\cb3 really don't care men have good\cb1 \
\cb3 intentions\cb1 \
\cb3 again your intention\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is this tit-for-tat young girl\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 this is this level up get the bag i'ma\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you right now\cb1 \
\cb3 this is going to end badly\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're not versed enough in the\cb1 \
\cb3 game to play with me\cb1 \
\cb3 and men on my level\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just i'm being straight up you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not ready for it\cb1 \

\cb3 what's special about you that separates\cb1 \

\cb3 all right uh and have you ever dated a\cb1 \
\cb3 black man\cb1 \
\cb3 i've dated\cb1 \
\cb3 one or two and it was literally just\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe like a couple of days so you you\cb1 \
\cb3 dated an above average earning\cb1 \
\cb3 potential white guy yes\cb1 \
\cb3 i haven't found any black ones\cb1 \
\cb3 well and again even\cb1 \
\cb3 this guy you want so ma'am due respect\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not happy with him if he would\cb1 \
\cb3 what would he think if he heard this\cb1 \
\cb3 um i don't know i don't think he would\cb1 \
\cb3 be very happy\cb1 \
\cb3 well this is so again\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're the woman that says you got\cb1 \
\cb3 men in your inbox and internet and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 like well\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in a whole relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 with the white guy but you came on my\cb1 \
\cb3 platform wanted me to give negative\cb1 \
\cb3 stats about black guys\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're not happy with the white guy\cb1 \
\cb3 you were that's why i'm like\cb1 \
\cb3 you really sound confused ma'am i'm just\cb1 \
\cb3 going\cb1 \
\cb3 it might not be the way you want the uh\cb1 \
\cb3 narrative to go but it's the overall\cb1 \
\cb3 truth\cb1 \
\cb3 you're with the guy who does he treat\cb1 \
\cb3 you well\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah he's he's amazing but\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm not in love so i don't care okay\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 and see man what i need you to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand if a man were to be moving\cb1 \
\cb3 like you're moving\cb1 \
\cb3 they would call him a dog you have all\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of pejorative things to say\cb1 \
\cb3 that a man is with a woman who treats\cb1 \
\cb3 him well and is amazing but\cb1 \
\cb3 over here he doesn't earn enough or\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever so you're looking to better\cb1 \
\cb3 deal him\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fine if you want to get out there\cb1 \
\cb3 but the world is going to give you\cb1 \
\cb3 what you put out and if you're looking\cb1 \
\cb3 to pick a guy if you're looking for\cb1 \
\cb3 to pick somebody based on income that's\cb1 \
\cb3 fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but you better be worth it because\cb1 \
\cb3 while you may be able to get let's just\cb1 \
\cb3 call him brad the nurse\cb1 \
\cb3 when you start talking about keith or\cb1 \
\cb3 marcus\cb1 \
\cb3 or enrique the doctor baby girl you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't hang with that kind of competition\cb1 \
\cb3 because they're coming for him\cb1 \
\cb3 they're coming from hard and they're\cb1 \
\cb3 coming with better deals than\cb1 \
\cb3 a hundred thousand dollars in debt and\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable\cb1 \
\cb3 so do these guys seek girls out and ask\cb1 \
\cb3 them to go on dates\cb1 \
\cb3 even if they're not really like\cb1 \
\cb3 interested in dating them what do you\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 so they've reached out to me and asked\cb1 \
\cb3 me to go on dates\cb1 \
\cb3 are you saying that what does dating\cb1 \
\cb3 mean like\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen to this you already know\cb1 \
\cb3 what dating means to us\cb1 \
\cb3 dating equals sex\cb1 \
\cb3 here's what you tell them i'm a virgin\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm gonna keep be a virgin till\cb1 \
\cb3 married see what those\cb1 \
\cb3 see how many times they respond back to\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay they're not trying to just date you\cb1 \
\cb3 they're trying to have sex with you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay see what i find is a lot of you\cb1 \
\cb3 so-called swirlers are really\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of confused but black men aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 your problem\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean have you ever called a white guy\cb1 \
\cb3 or white and they gave you this much\cb1 \
\cb3 information\cb1 \
\cb3 no but you're the only channel i watch\cb1 \
\cb3 like this\cb1 \
\cb3 what but again the fact that you're\cb1 \
\cb3 watching me at\cb1 \
\cb3 all is is kind of amazing right because\cb1 \
\cb3 apparently we're not supposed to exist\cb1 \
\cb3 see that\cb1 \
\cb3 i was here in atlanta with my mix group\cb1 \
\cb3 this weekend\cb1 \
\cb3 and had brothers in from around the\cb1 \
\cb3 count men from black men from around the\cb1 \
\cb3 country\cb1 \
\cb3 i i understand that but you said it\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself they read at a fourth grade\cb1 \
\cb3 reading level on average so it's very\cb1 \
\cb3 great uh excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 that's on average what does that have to\cb1 \
\cb3 do with the black men that were here\cb1 \
\cb3 fluent in see how you just did that\cb1 \
\cb3 i said i had my mix group here in\cb1 \
\cb3 atlanta and i had\cb1 \
\cb3 and you automatically undercut your\cb1 \
\cb3 programming is to tear black men down so\cb1 \
\cb3 quickly\cb1 \
\cb3 so uh it's no wonder you can't find a\cb1 \
\cb3 black man\cb1 \
\cb3 you you don't like us\cb1 \
\cb3 i i mean and with all due respect i've\cb1 \
\cb3 never for some reason i definitely don't\cb1 \
\cb3 attract dark-skinned black men i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think that they like the reflection of\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 that is your again you keep trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 wait you keep trying to weave this in\cb1 \
\cb3 that is your opinion based upon what\cb1 \
\cb3 just the fact that even low i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 like they seem to what okay you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 date black men so you cannot really tell\cb1 \
\cb3 me what black\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you don't rate black men yet you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 you you talk as though you know black\cb1 \
\cb3 men and you don't date black men\cb1 \
\cb3 you sound because i had to stop because\cb1 \
\cb3 of all the things that i was seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 stop at what age 15\cb1 \
\cb3 no i stopped around 1920. and the white\cb1 \
\cb3 boy ain't doing no better\cb1 \
\cb3 i've never met a white man that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 colorist oh my god\cb1 \
\cb3 what color is your father my father my\cb1 \
\cb3 father is\cb1 \
\cb3 a black man right how long have your\cb1 \
\cb3 father and mother been married\cb1 \
\cb3 they've been married for 25 years is he\cb1 \
\cb3 worth the damn\cb1 \
\cb3 he has some issues wow\cb1 \
\cb3 wow is he your skin complexion\cb1 \
\cb3 he he is and i actually think he can\cb1 \
\cb3 come here\cb1 \
\cb3 he's i i'm actually pretty sure he's a\cb1 \
\cb3 colorist my mom wow\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my god i\cb1 \
\cb3 need better health i mean did you hear\cb1 \
\cb3 what this woman just said\cb1 \
\cb3 oh this is the problem i have with you\cb1 \
\cb3 swirlers and you colorist people\cb1 \
\cb3 you make so many logical fallacies and\cb1 \
\cb3 jumps and it\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean back it down man where did that\cb1 \
\cb3 make up let me let me back it down\cb1 \
\cb3 okay your mother your father has been\cb1 \
\cb3 married to your mother for 25 years\cb1 \
\cb3 yes and you just disrespected your\cb1 \
\cb3 father\cb1 \
\cb3 which makes sense because you're\cb1 \
\cb3 disrespectful to black men\cb1 \
\cb3 which was the first question i asked you\cb1 \
\cb3 you are this uh the focal point for the\cb1 \
\cb3 issues you have with black men it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 your dark skin\cb1 \
\cb3 it's your dark attitude you need help\cb1 \
\cb3 you can laugh you can look no it is very\cb1 \
\cb3 fair\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't say things lightly man and the\cb1 \
\cb3 laughter remember gentlemen i told you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a tell\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am i said it last broadcast at 22\cb1 \
\cb3 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 you were far too angry and\cb1 \
\cb3 i find it interesting that many of you\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a father and it\cb1 \
\cb3 at every turn you've torn my father\cb1 \
\cb3 likes less than my mother\cb1 \
\cb3 so your father ain't worth [ __ ] in your\cb1 \
\cb3 eyes\cb1 \
\cb3 he to be fair he was very abusive\cb1 \
\cb3 extremely abusive abusive\cb1 \
\cb3 how many times so how many times do you\cb1 \
\cb3 break your arm\cb1 \
\cb3 um the police were at our house multiple\cb1 \
\cb3 times and he was actually\cb1 \
\cb3 banned from our home for a month goes\cb1 \
\cb3 along with that yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 but they okay hold on hold on hold on\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna go down this path okay i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna go down this path\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 your mother was just sitting there\cb1 \
\cb3 knitting uh sweaters and\cb1 \
\cb3 mittens for everybody and your father\cb1 \
\cb3 just came in whooping ass\cb1 \
\cb3 no exactly so you don't excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 you are old enough to know relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is what happens too often in\cb1 \
\cb3 the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 you and children tend to judge\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships from the kids standpoint\cb1 \
\cb3 are your mother and father still\cb1 \
\cb3 together yes\cb1 \
\cb3 then apparently she knows more than you\cb1 \
\cb3 do\cb1 \
\cb3 are you saying it's okay to hit i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 you i'm saying stay in the child's place\cb1 \
\cb3 because you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know everything and lastly if\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my god and if your mother were to\cb1 \
\cb3 hear her daughter\cb1 \
\cb3 sit here and question her decisions\cb1 \
\cb3 oh she knows she talks about leaving him\cb1 \
\cb3 all the time right\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is another problem you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 talk to your daughters and wonder why\cb1 \
\cb3 they're poisoned against their fathers\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am let me make it real plain\cb1 \
\cb3 you need counseling\cb1 \
\cb3 you got a lot of issues you need to talk\cb1 \
\cb3 out but you've turned\cb1 \
\cb3 all this into colorism and\cb1 \
\cb3 black men and you cannot point to\cb1 \
\cb3 individuals black men who what if did\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody's\cb1 \
\cb3 what did that what does a black man who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't your father do to you\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's well known that the majority\cb1 \
\cb3 of them what is the black man that ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 joking what does a black man does not\cb1 \
\cb3 your father do\cb1 \
\cb3 to you it's well known that the majority\cb1 \
\cb3 of what did a black man does not your\cb1 \
\cb3 father\cb1 \
\cb3 do to you i've had some really bad\cb1 \
\cb3 experiences such as black men\cb1 \
\cb3 such as as the chance\cb1 \
\cb3 just such as i remember one guy\cb1 \
\cb3 we went to we went out to eat and he\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 he didn't want to pay oh he didn't want\cb1 \
\cb3 to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's excuse me excuse me excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want everybody to listen i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 waiting for\cb1 \
\cb3 you know attempted r or something\cb1 \
\cb3 and she said the worst thing she could\cb1 \
\cb3 pull up\cb1 \
\cb3 was a black man who did not want to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet you were willing to come on here\cb1 \
\cb3 and tear black men down\cb1 \
\cb3 want me to quote negative black men\cb1 \
\cb3 stats and i ask you what\cb1 \
\cb3 has a black man done to you that's not\cb1 \
\cb3 your father and all you can say is he\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't want to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am that's insane that you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 all these black men that you don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're so ready to quote stats and\cb1 \
\cb3 facts and statistics\cb1 \
\cb3 when you've made up black men to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 boogeyman this is this color purpling of\cb1 \
\cb3 black men\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm done with this man i can't i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 do this anymore no no\cb1 \
\cb3 get up man\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 i let that go because\cb1 \
\cb3 i find it interesting that so many women\cb1 \
\cb3 like to say that these male\cb1 \
\cb3 spaces are so full of misogynist and\cb1 \
\cb3 hurt people and this and that\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm like if you peel the layers of\cb1 \
\cb3 the onion back\cb1 \
\cb3 what did a black man do to her\cb1 \
\cb3 she had nothing he didn't want to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 for dinner\cb1 \
\cb3 that's it he didn't try to\cb1 \
\cb3 that's it\cb1 \
\cb3 well mom and dad they're still married\cb1 \
\cb3 right well the police\cb1 \
\cb3 again how many times did you hear a\cb1 \
\cb3 terror father try to\cb1 \
\cb3 take shots at her dad lady you need\cb1 \
\cb3 therapy\cb1 \
\cb3 because fast forward she's with\cb1 \
\cb3 brad he's a great guy eight months\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're still in a deep\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna make me rich though that's\cb1 \
\cb3 another segment for casey\cb1 \
\cb3 i got a casey three pete i'm serious\cb1 \
\cb3 casey i'm not trying to be funny but i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't really need you to\cb1 \
\cb3 go back and try to make up stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm being serious you need to seek\cb1 \
\cb3 therapy hey nicole jay\cb1 \
\cb3 let me go ahead and i'm you you\cb1 \
\cb3 again she wants to go into hundreds of\cb1 \
\cb3 thousands of debt\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars of debt just to say hi\cb1 \
\cb3 haha i'm good how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's all right we going very nice\cb1 \
\cb3 picture you got there\cb1 \
\cb3 what you got for me um high value women\cb1 \
\cb3 um what do you have on the topic well\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i\cb1 \
\cb3 actually was kind of talking about this\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 like a topic of value the other day and\cb1 \
\cb3 i just had a clarifying question\cb1 \
\cb3 so um as it relates like a woman and her\cb1 \
\cb3 value so\cb1 \
\cb3 i hear a lot of women say you know uh\cb1 \
\cb3 don't give it all up to a man you know\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't have the ring you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 married because you know why would he\cb1 \
\cb3 marry you without\cb1 \
\cb3 you know why we marry you if he's\cb1 \
\cb3 getting it all so\cb1 \
\cb3 um i have a boyfriend we've been dating\cb1 \
\cb3 for about a month and\cb1 \
\cb3 i enjoy doing things like if i'm at his\cb1 \
\cb3 house like i don't mind like cleaning up\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't mind cooking while i'm there my\cb1 \
\cb3 mom and friends and just other people\cb1 \
\cb3 you know they give me that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the conversation like why are\cb1 \
\cb3 you doing that he's not going to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 you if you're doing this why would he\cb1 \
\cb3 marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 so i just want to know is there any\cb1 \
\cb3 truth to that like does that lower my\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 well let's take a few\cb1 \
\cb3 uh steps your mother and father married\cb1 \
\cb3 um they were my dad passed when i was a\cb1 \
\cb3 teenager\cb1 \
\cb3 sorry to hear that um how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 24 next week and how does your\cb1 \
\cb3 boyfriend\cb1 \
\cb3 32. uh do you want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 yes uh\cb1 \
\cb3 does he want to get married yes\cb1 \
\cb3 did you start dating him with the\cb1 \
\cb3 express\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding that i want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 100 did he did he accept the fact that\cb1 \
\cb3 i can see myself marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah he's the one who brought it up all\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 um you've been dating a month\cb1 \
\cb3 um well\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just going to assume you guys have\cb1 \
\cb3 already been intimate things are you\cb1 \
\cb3 cleaning up houses\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah um fine then\cb1 \
\cb3 your mom and your aunts and everybody\cb1 \
\cb3 else need to kind of stay\cb1 \
\cb3 out of the way um\cb1 \
\cb3 because you've had the conversation i\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get married you want to get\cb1 \
\cb3 married um\cb1 \
\cb3 now i hear what they're saying about\cb1 \
\cb3 don't give\cb1 \
\cb3 too much away but oftentimes what women\cb1 \
\cb3 are saying is\cb1 \
\cb3 don't do that without having\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations without\cb1 \
\cb3 just assuming it's all going to work out\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd like to be married by what age\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to be married and like with a kid\cb1 \
\cb3 on the way by 27.\cb1 \
\cb3 so he wants to be married by what age\cb1 \
\cb3 well we didn't actually discuss specific\cb1 \
\cb3 times\cb1 \
\cb3 that he would want to be married okay so\cb1 \
\cb3 at what point do you think it would be\cb1 \
\cb3 appropriate to discuss\cb1 \
\cb3 time frames um i'd say\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe about four months in so a few more\cb1 \
\cb3 months\cb1 \
\cb3 tomorrow okay\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on but i didn't think it was\cb1 \
\cb3 appropriate for me to bring that up\cb1 \
\cb3 you hear that\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i hear ticking that's your\cb1 \
\cb3 biological clock\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to be married\cb1 \
\cb3 in short order you need to make it known\cb1 \
\cb3 if he brought it up if he brought up the\cb1 \
\cb3 fact he wants me see what you're afraid\cb1 \
\cb3 of is he won't be on the same page\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah ultimately well better to find that\cb1 \
\cb3 out now\cb1 \
\cb3 than four or five months from now and\cb1 \
\cb3 much further down the line emotionally\cb1 \
\cb3 and everything else right\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah necessary\cb1 \
\cb3 my goal is my thought process is a man\cb1 \
\cb3 should lead this process\cb1 \
\cb3 20 32 and you're 24\cb1 \
\cb3 if you know you want to be married and\cb1 \
\cb3 he knows he wants to be married he\cb1 \
\cb3 really shouldn't be dating you\cb1 \
\cb3 unless he's vetting you for marriage and\cb1 \
\cb3 knowing the approximate time frame is\cb1 \
\cb3 reasonable\cb1 \
\cb3 okay asking a question all right um\cb1 \
\cb3 when we started seeing one another you\cb1 \
\cb3 knew i wanted to get married you know i\cb1 \
\cb3 you you know i wanted to get married i\cb1 \
\cb3 know you want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 um when would you like to be\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to have this question he you\cb1 \
\cb3 should be asking him but you need to\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 and pay attention to the answer\cb1 \
\cb3 if he's saying cause like i i had a guy\cb1 \
\cb3 on the show the other day\cb1 \
\cb3 and uh i i actually slapped the [ __ ] out\cb1 \
\cb3 of him\cb1 \
\cb3 because he was in a similar position\cb1 \
\cb3 dating a 20-something year old and he's\cb1 \
\cb3 in his 30s\cb1 \
\cb3 and i said do you want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah does she want to get married yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 all right and when do you want to get he\cb1 \
\cb3 says my mom has been asking the same\cb1 \
\cb3 question i was like well when would you\cb1 \
\cb3 like to\cb1 \
\cb3 see yourself get married it's like oh\cb1 \
\cb3 you know three to five years and i said\cb1 \
\cb3 all right did you let that young girl\cb1 \
\cb3 know that 20-something-year-old\cb1 \
\cb3 know that you want to wait three to five\cb1 \
\cb3 years he said no\cb1 \
\cb3 see you got to know he's\cb1 \
\cb3 he knows and i will tell you i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 it's something you want to know so you\cb1 \
\cb3 best go ahead and ask\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so should i relax with the wifely\cb1 \
\cb3 things i'm doing now\cb1 \
\cb3 well average looking 40. you join the\cb1 \
\cb3 panel if it says ladies and gentlemen\cb1 \
\cb3 but i want to make sure you have\cb1 \
\cb3 something to add and you're not just\cb1 \
\cb3 going to go on so what would you like\cb1 \
\cb3 this yes guys don't just jump on the\cb1 \
\cb3 panel i'm not going to let you on here\cb1 \
\cb3 just because\cb1 \
\cb3 okay just listen go ahead okay uh\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'd like to add is i think a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 what you say is\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely true not just for girls\cb1 \
\cb3 but for guys as well and i think it's\cb1 \
\cb3 true because\cb1 \
\cb3 they have to understand that unless you\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 standards in life you will never achieve\cb1 \
\cb3 anything you'll never be anything and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what you're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 that they have to have standards but but\cb1 \
\cb3 if they do\cb1 \
\cb3 they also have to transform themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 they can actually meet their standards\cb1 \
\cb3 because any man who is successful is\cb1 \
\cb3 going to want to be around somebody who\cb1 \
\cb3 is healthy attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 are you married no no i have a\cb1 \
\cb3 girlfriend but\cb1 \
\cb3 are you guys getting married am i\cb1 \
\cb3 getting married\cb1 \
\cb3 well my mom asked me that same question\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh i'm asking\cb1 \
\cb3 do you want to get married i want to get\cb1 \
\cb3 married eventually yes yes\cb1 \
\cb3 what's eventually eventually is\cb1 \
\cb3 you see with the no no no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is why no you're a 32 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 man just give me\cb1 \
\cb3 shoot it straight do you want to get\cb1 \
\cb3 married what's eventually i do yes yes\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i do then what's eventually\cb1 \
\cb3 eventually is\cb1 \
\cb3 given the fact that eventually okay if\cb1 \
\cb3 anything goes wrong but eventually oh oh\cb1 \
\cb3 oh give me the time frame the time yes\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yes a little bit totally the bigger\cb1 \
\cb3 pardon i got it now okay\cb1 \
\cb3 time frame would be about three to five\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 three times three to five years how old\cb1 \

\cb3 how old is she well she she's 26\cb1 \

\cb3 tonight\cb1 \
\cb3 so did you when did you join the\cb1 \
\cb3 broadcast\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so when i said becoming a high\cb1 \
\cb3 value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 it was more than just that part\cb1 \
\cb3 all right hold on make an announcement\cb1 \
\cb3 if you come in my chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 and you say something like this personal\cb1 \
\cb3 super chat\cb1 \

\cb3 do you let me go ahead and unmute\cb1 \
\cb3 letitia do you want to be married one\cb1 \
\cb3 day\cb1 \
\cb3 do you want this same high value man too\cb1 \
\cb3 all right well are you are you what are\cb1 \
\cb3 you offering him what are you bringing\cb1 \
\cb3 to the table\cb1 \
\cb3 are you that's gonna be requirements\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies you gotta figure out what you\cb1 \
\cb3 bring because\cb1 \
\cb3 as you can see the competition is stiff\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful fit feminine that's a given\cb1 \
\cb3 latisha what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i am good great conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 um so i just want to get it back on\cb1 \
\cb3 track a little bit and\cb1 \
\cb3 describe how a high-value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um so the first thing that i\cb1 \
\cb3 consider what i consider for a\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value woman is her femininity\cb1 \
\cb3 femininity is not something you could\cb1 \
\cb3 turn off or on she just either\cb1 \
\cb3 is or she isn't a lot of women their\cb1 \
\cb3 femininity is dormant\cb1 \
\cb3 and so you can bring it out you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 bring it to the forefront\cb1 \
\cb3 another thing is she's elegant\cb1 \
\cb3 she is not for everybody and men will\cb1 \
\cb3 recognize this\cb1 \
\cb3 it does not matter where she is men will\cb1 \
\cb3 recognize\cb1 \
\cb3 that she is a woman that is not for\cb1 \
\cb3 everyone and he will\cb1 \
\cb3 engage her accordingly i don't care if\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a thug on a corner\cb1 \
\cb3 or the ceo in the business room they\cb1 \
\cb3 will recognize that this is a lady\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a woman whom you will not play\cb1 \
\cb3 games with you will\cb1 \
\cb3 not play around with you will not\cb1 \
\cb3 disrespect or be disrespectful\cb1 \
\cb3 in front of she will embody\cb1 \
\cb3 the same lady in the streets\cb1 \
\cb3 and his freak between the sheets\cb1 \
\cb3 she will only be that for her man she's\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to be in a club\cb1 \
\cb3 twerking bending it over and i also want\cb1 \
\cb3 the fellas to know that\cb1 \
\cb3 bougie does not equate to high value\cb1 \
\cb3 women saying that too bougie does not\cb1 \
\cb3 equate to high value a woman could be\cb1 \
\cb3 bougie like the finer things in life but\cb1 \
\cb3 that does not make her a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you very much yeah that last one i\cb1 \
\cb3 like that one yeah bougie does make you\cb1 \
\cb3 high value uh\cb1 \
\cb3 and i want you guys to be cl that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 i left some of these things to\cb1 \
\cb3 not open to interpretation but for you\cb1 \
\cb3 to fill in i gave you the bulk i want\cb1 \
\cb3 you to color around the edges\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you going how are you miss\cb1 \
\cb3 walker\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you no he's not yet i'm none of\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 or not i watch your show a lot but i've\cb1 \
\cb3 never like actually got to come in and\cb1 \
\cb3 chat before\cb1 \
\cb3 nadia or nice which one are you that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 corny joke\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of people say that though oh your\cb1 \
\cb3 name you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what you got for me what you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 oh so um pretty much i didn't come in\cb1 \
\cb3 the the beginning of the show so i came\cb1 \
\cb3 in like maybe\cb1 \
\cb3 30 minutes ago when you were on the\cb1 \
\cb3 phone with casey\cb1 \
\cb3 and i know like i watch a lot of your um\cb1 \
\cb3 your streams and a lot of the women it's\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm only 20. so i know you're gonna say\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm too young and like i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 no no i'm not gonna just automatically\cb1 \
\cb3 say you're too young yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 but i don't know i just noticed that\cb1 \
\cb3 like a lot of these women are like so\cb1 \
\cb3 much older than me and it's like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know like they think that they have\cb1 \
\cb3 it together and then like it made me\cb1 \
\cb3 think like okay so i really need to get\cb1 \
\cb3 on my feminine journey and learn how to\cb1 \
\cb3 be it because these women thought they\cb1 \
\cb3 had it figured out you know so for me\cb1 \
\cb3 um a feminine or what is it high value\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not just feminine beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 intelligent and i remember i watched\cb1 \
\cb3 one of your other shows before and you\cb1 \
\cb3 were like a high value man like\cb1 \
\cb3 what can you do for him you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm saying and you were talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 how\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that makes that kind of income\cb1 \
\cb3 like he's dropping off his own laundry\cb1 \
\cb3 to get folded you know he hasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 like it's like and all these women\cb1 \
\cb3 they're like well\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i i'm a woman you know i could\cb1 \
\cb3 clean all this stuff but it's like he\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't need that so it kind of put me\cb1 \
\cb3 in the mindset like\cb1 \
\cb3 what can i do you know what i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 like i am here's a question for you\cb1 \
\cb3 here's a question\cb1 \
\cb3 who is your who's like your your your\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine mentor or who are the women who\cb1 \
\cb3 are\cb1 \
\cb3 influencing you in your journey to\cb1 \
\cb3 becoming a\cb1 \
\cb3 full-fledged woman like an adult already\cb1 \
\cb3 well you're an adult already because\cb1 \
\cb3 who's helping you on your journey\cb1 \
\cb3 um so a lot of the journey has been like\cb1 \
\cb3 myself but then i also do have like\cb1 \
\cb3 sisters that are my blood sisters but\cb1 \
\cb3 they're my sisters they're\cb1 \
\cb3 muslim sisters and they're all very very\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine\cb1 \
\cb3 um my older sister she just married a\cb1 \
\cb3 high volume man who's also muslim and\cb1 \
\cb3 they live over in egypt\cb1 \
\cb3 you know and she inspired me a lot you\cb1 \
\cb3 know and it's kind of helped my mindset\cb1 \
\cb3 because i used to be in a very\cb1 \
\cb3 independent mindset like i moved out\cb1 \
\cb3 when i was 16 so\cb1 \
\cb3 i used to be like in a very independent\cb1 \
\cb3 mindset one thing i\cb1 \
\cb3 one thing that i i think that is wise\cb1 \
\cb3 for women is to\cb1 \
\cb3 surround yourself or i think everyone we\cb1 \
\cb3 all need mentors\cb1 \
\cb3 in the stage of you know once we turn 18\cb1 \
\cb3 we think we're grown\cb1 \
\cb3 and at every phase in life there should\cb1 \
\cb3 be somebody helping to guide us\cb1 \
\cb3 on through and at one point you you know\cb1 \
\cb3 down the line you become that to\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody else\cb1 \
\cb3 i can speak a lot of these things but i\cb1 \
\cb3 think being surrounded by\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine women women who have the kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of outcomes or the mindsets\cb1 \
\cb3 whether they already have the outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 or if they have the mindsets to get the\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of outcomes you say you want\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're going to need that kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of support yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 there's so much information out here for\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies and\cb1 \
\cb3 it is easy for attractive women to end\cb1 \
\cb3 up getting\cb1 \
\cb3 called pygmies or this or that or where\cb1 \
\cb3 do you go\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean it's just an information overload\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be around\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be in contact with\cb1 \
\cb3 like-minded feminine women\cb1 \
\cb3 um that would be the most important\cb1 \
\cb3 thing because here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 as uh latisha was saying earlier\cb1 \
\cb3 truly high value women separate\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 by their overall energy their aura\cb1 \
\cb3 however you want to frame it\cb1 \
\cb3 and men are drawn to those women\cb1 \
\cb3 in a way that they're not drawn to other\cb1 \
\cb3 women they approach women like that for\cb1 \
\cb3 wives\cb1 \
\cb3 versus other women for just um fun\cb1 \
\cb3 so go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 um women like now it's like kind of like\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing like\cb1 \
\cb3 it's popular to have like been with\cb1 \
\cb3 money and stuff like that but a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 women like don't need that or they're\cb1 \
\cb3 not ready for that you know\cb1 \
\cb3 like and for a long time i didn't even\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 that i was like seeking a high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 because i was just dating regular people\cb1 \
\cb3 and i did one high value man and i\cb1 \
\cb3 messed it up because oh sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 and i messed it because i wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 mentally where i need to be i was still\cb1 \
\cb3 very young\cb1 \
\cb3 and so that kind of you know but being\cb1 \
\cb3 around him it made me feel like i needed\cb1 \
\cb3 to be\cb1 \
\cb3 on top of things you know it made me\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get up and do stuff you know\cb1 \
\cb3 because he was so\cb1 \
\cb3 driven so then i tried to get in a\cb1 \
\cb3 regular and i was just i couldn't do it\cb1 \
\cb3 you know\cb1 \
\cb3 um i have a facebook group called the\cb1 \

\cb3 and vice versa women too don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 you're coming under just because you put\cb1 \
\cb3 two dollars now you can say what you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to about men\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want extremes around here\cb1 \
\cb3 there's other platforms other places for\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a men's channel run by men but\cb1 \
\cb3 women are more than welcome\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm talking to women at this sector you\cb1 \
\cb3 know but for years i talked to men\cb1 \
\cb3 at the end of the day it's not about me\cb1 \
\cb3 it's about you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 it's about you guys and for the guys who\cb1 \
\cb3 have an issue with the direction and\cb1 \
\cb3 channel\cb1 \
\cb3 believe me men are happy with direction\cb1 \
\cb3 men who matter are happy with this thing\cb1 \
\cb3 theo my dog what's going on we gotta get\cb1 \
\cb3 the other double bond\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm actually working you actually got a\cb1 \
\cb3 song coming\cb1 \

\cb3 there's a lot of cursing in it\cb1 \
\cb3 but we just got in man just remember\cb1 \
\cb3 sometimes you just gotta remind yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 that you are the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i i think this is good for you\cb1 \
\cb3 all to remind yourself from time to time\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't all have it right um and\cb1 \
\cb3 remember\cb1 \
\cb3 i look at i remember when i was a\cb1 \
\cb3 younger guy depending on your influences\cb1 \
\cb3 man some of these people are\cb1 \
\cb3 impressionable\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing we went through our\cb1 \
\cb3 actions not through an argument\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how you do it men show your work\cb1 \
\cb3 win through your actions not through an\cb1 \
\cb3 argument\cb1 \
\cb3 and slowly but surely when we're doing\cb1 \
\cb3 what we need to be doing as men on our\cb1 \
\cb3 purpose and our hustle and our grind\cb1 \
\cb3 working networking together that's an\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive picture\cb1 \
\cb3 first off is that good for outcomes for\cb1 \
\cb3 us and it's an attractive picture\cb1 \
\cb3 to everybody else other men recognize\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys are to become that they're\cb1 \
\cb3 they're a competition they're to be\cb1 \
\cb3 contended with yeah i it's always a good\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 always a good thing all right so show is\cb1 \

\cb3 what is really going on what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 is today far too many women\cb1 \
\cb3 are losing their mind\cb1 \
\cb3 when it comes to dating in 2020\cb1 \
\cb3 2020 has been a year of foolishness\cb1 \
\cb3 and i've heard some real crazy stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard a woman say that the man is\cb1 \
\cb3 broke\cb1 \
\cb3 if he ain't making at least double what\cb1 \
\cb3 she makes\cb1 \
\cb3 you've heard b simone talking about she\cb1 \
\cb3 needs\cb1 \
\cb3 she don't want anybody but an\cb1 \
\cb3 entrepreneur\cb1 \
\cb3 because he understands her mind so they\cb1 \
\cb3 could be able to fly out to\cb1 \
\cb3 paris for lunch as if a busy\cb1 \
\cb3 successful productive productive high\cb1 \
\cb3 value man would have time to just\cb1 \
\cb3 fly away just because b simone\cb1 \
\cb3 thought it was a good idea then it even\cb1 \
\cb3 came up to the point where\cb1 \
\cb3 there was a woman that looks like\cb1 \
\cb3 trina's\cb1 \
\cb3 the rapper trina looked like her distant\cb1 \
\cb3 cousin with them\cb1 \
\cb3 crazy finger waves in their hand i mean\cb1 \

\cb3 in my opinion talking about she don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want no\cb1 \
\cb3 nine to five guy she need a dude to make\cb1 \
\cb3 fast money\cb1 \

\cb3 dating and mating situations where we\cb1 \
\cb3 got\cb1 \
\cb3 average looking women again\cb1 \
\cb3 these women are not la-9s\cb1 \

\cb3 runway or gracing the cover of\cb1 \
\cb3 anybody's magazine\cb1 \
\cb3 none of these women were that level\cb1 \
\cb3 but talking crazy as if\cb1 \
\cb3 they only needed a man who was a\cb1 \
\cb3 multi-millionaire\cb1 \
\cb3 other than that they can't be bothered\cb1 \

\cb3 of her looks\cb1 \
\cb3 being with the richest successful man\cb1 \
\cb3 outside the black community talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 shanita birkenback\cb1 \
\cb3 this [ __ ] only flies in our culture\cb1 \
\cb3 to where you can have women who are\cb1 \
\cb3 sixes\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable sixes at best\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking and talking and acting\cb1 \
\cb3 as if they do they are entitled\cb1 \
\cb3 to mad craziness and my question is\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 does she speak for you because\cb1 \
\cb3 this has been a rampant thing dissing\cb1 \
\cb3 dogging\cb1 \
\cb3 talking down to productive competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful working men\cb1 \
\cb3 as if you know not only do you need to\cb1 \
\cb3 make six figures\cb1 \

\cb3 eight figures in her song i'm gonna show\cb1 \
\cb3 you how to pillar eight figure dude\cb1 \
\cb3 look here babe if you and cuevo go down\cb1 \

\cb3 back in\cb1 \
\cb3 athletics and entertainment that's its\cb1 \
\cb3 own world those people float around one\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 let's finish out let's finish this out\cb1 \
\cb3 let's see what these likes are up now\cb1 \

\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 all right guys please let's not have to\cb1 \

\cb3 one day not just having to play that\cb1 \
\cb3 song i would like one day where we don't\cb1 \

\cb3 one day well we don't have to do that\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so let me go and put this\cb1 \
\cb3 birkin back over here\cb1 \
\cb3 because these things are expensive and\cb1 \
\cb3 just because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're dating a member of the migos and\cb1 \
\cb3 he can afford that kind of stuff it's\cb1 \
\cb3 crazy to run around and tell\cb1 \
\cb3 young women that if he can't pay your\cb1 \
\cb3 bills or buy you a birkin bag throw that\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] to the streets\cb1 \
\cb3 not everyone can afford a birkin not\cb1 \
\cb3 everyone can even get\cb1 \
\cb3 one again there is a waiting list to get\cb1 \
\cb3 these bags\cb1 \
\cb3 you could walk in there with the money\cb1 \
\cb3 and air meds would turn you away cause\cb1 \
\cb3 they got it like that\cb1 \
\cb3 trust me i know them very well\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies please stop following this trend\cb1 \
\cb3 wrote one hater birken bags literally\cb1 \
\cb3 look like purses that sell that\cb1 \
\cb3 marshalls and ross added another\cb1 \
\cb3 instagram well\cb1 \
\cb3 no that's wrong and\cb1 \
\cb3 the reason the bags are expensive is\cb1 \
\cb3 because of\cb1 \
\cb3 value demand the market demanded them to\cb1 \
\cb3 be that expensive\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean the reason diamonds are expensive\cb1 \
\cb3 they restricted supply\cb1 \
\cb3 they restricted supply and they've upped\cb1 \
\cb3 the demand so they can charge what they\cb1 \
\cb3 like but\cb1 \
\cb3 nonetheless\cb1 \
\cb3 you know athletes and entertainers\cb1 \
\cb3 oftentimes\cb1 \
\cb3 speak as they don't understand the real\cb1 \
\cb3 world because they don't they don't live\cb1 \
\cb3 in the real world\cb1 \
\cb3 because they make money in a different\cb1 \
\cb3 manner if they had to come out here and\cb1 \
\cb3 make money for their skills\cb1 \
\cb3 that were not athletic not entertainment\cb1 \
\cb3 related\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of this stuff would stop one\cb1 \
\cb3 practical twitter suggested another way\cb1 \
\cb3 to use the twenty thousand dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of buying a purse i'd rather pay\cb1 \
\cb3 off student loans\cb1 \
\cb3 spending 20k on a birkin bag another\cb1 \
\cb3 twitter fan called down sweetie\cb1 \
\cb3 who was celebrating the launch of her\cb1 \
\cb3 new single back to the streets thursday\cb1 \
\cb3 nights\cb1 \
\cb3 uh for asking her man to buy her a\cb1 \
\cb3 burger bag\cb1 \

\cb3 guess what you can get one two three\cb1 \
\cb3 four five fifty thousand dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 really close to forty five but we'll\cb1 \
\cb3 give it fifty forty five\cb1 \
\cb3 fifty if you're one two three four five\cb1 \
\cb3 six right here fit\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative and single and a six right\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 you can get one two three four five\cb1 \
\cb3 sixty thousand dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 right there fifty four to sixty\cb1 \
\cb3 if you are an eight right here\cb1 \
\cb3 you can get an eighty thousand dollar\cb1 \
\cb3 seventy two to eighty and if you're one\cb1 \
\cb3 two three four five six seven eight nine\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yes still for youtube\cb1 \
\cb3 because today it's\cb1 \
\cb3 oh and we also need to factor in your\cb1 \
\cb3 age\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm talking about women who are under\cb1 \
\cb3 30 because when you ladies get over 30\cb1 \
\cb3 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 your your list of asks start to increase\cb1 \
\cb3 because nothing's new to you anymore\cb1 \
\cb3 you're you're and that's backwards let\cb1 \
\cb3 me go ahead and finish this out at nine\cb1 \
\cb3 roughly 90 000 90 000\cb1 \
\cb3 but nine is pretty much the top of the\cb1 \
\cb3 scale 90 plus\cb1 \
\cb3 you can get 90 plus but nowhere you know\cb1 \
\cb3 that's where the starting point if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a four\cb1 \
\cb3 forty grand average guy\cb1 \
\cb3 average stick i don't know what's wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 with being average but let's get into\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 this tends to be a big problem\cb1 \
\cb3 especially with this tends to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 problem when women\cb1 \
\cb3 tend to get older just because you are\cb1 \
\cb3 in the danger zone\cb1 \
\cb3 just because you have your i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 or your masters or whatever and because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're making 70\cb1 \
\cb3 000 a year doesn't mean you can get a\cb1 \
\cb3 man making 70 000\cb1 \
\cb3 a year you can get a man based on how\cb1 \
\cb3 you look\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's why a lot of women have a\cb1 \
\cb3 problem you can you get a man based on\cb1 \
\cb3 how you look\cb1 \
\cb3 not based on on how you feel or your\cb1 \
\cb3 education or whatever that's not how it\cb1 \
\cb3 works with me\cb1 \
\cb3 and sadly more you ladies especially you\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 especially you women uh what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 here we go especially you women right\cb1 \
\cb3 here we know what's going on right here\cb1 \
\cb3 especially you women right here\cb1 \
\cb3 you go sweetie oh come back quavo i need\cb1 \
\cb3 another birkin please\cb1 \
\cb3 oh where's my birkin yeah you better\cb1 \
\cb3 ever let him go\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies you need to start asking for less\cb1 \
\cb3 the older you are\cb1 \
\cb3 the older you are the over 30 you need\cb1 \
\cb3 to start asking for less\cb1 \
\cb3 overweight you need to be asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 less anything\cb1 \
\cb3 on your record you got to ask for less\cb1 \
\cb3 and the thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why so many men over 35\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to date older women because\cb1 \
\cb3 taking you\cb1 \
\cb3 to a nice steakhouse\cb1 \
\cb3 is not special you know like it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 it's easy it's easier to please\cb1 \
\cb3 a young woman because\cb1 \
\cb3 just by sake of argument they have not\cb1 \
\cb3 had\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't have the money their own\cb1 \
\cb3 means to go do these things\cb1 \
\cb3 so ladies understand what men are\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm not trying to i need you to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 what's out here just because you have\cb1 \
\cb3 your phd\cb1 \
\cb3 or whatever you still can oh you can\cb1 \
\cb3 only you get what you look like\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean if that's not fair to you i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 but a man gets what his pockets are like\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you look like and this is a part\cb1 \
\cb3 of the reason why so many women have\cb1 \
\cb3 an issue with me when it comes to weight\cb1 \
\cb3 because 80 percent of you are\cb1 \
\cb3 automatically knocked out because you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't wait\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't way right\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that's not me\cb1 \
\cb3 but you look at if you look at men\cb1 \
\cb3 you know men who are six figure seven\cb1 \
\cb3 figure men\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna start to see women on their\cb1 \
\cb3 arms\cb1 \
\cb3 uh who are not you don't see\cb1 \
\cb3 uh big women on these on these guys arms\cb1 \
\cb3 let me go back can you explain\cb1 \
\cb3 to women why having an only fans or\cb1 \
\cb3 incentivized sexuality yeah if you got\cb1 \
\cb3 only fans you might as well\cb1 \
\cb3 you're knocking yourself out understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something you ladies man\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you guys got too much\cb1 \
\cb3 experience you got only fans\cb1 \
\cb3 you got no shot at really getting a\cb1 \
\cb3 decent dude\cb1 \

\cb3 who's 50 50.\cb1 \

\cb3 honestly i feel like it kind of goes 50\cb1 \
\cb3 50. so i am currently in a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 and my boyfriend and i\cb1 \
\cb3 have talked about this because you know\cb1 \
\cb3 it's all over instagram\cb1 \
\cb3 and he even says himself that\cb1 \
\cb3 if a woman wants a birkin he even says\cb1 \
\cb3 that she has to\cb1 \
\cb3 earn the birkin and there's even some\cb1 \
\cb3 things that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know a woman might think they do to\cb1 \
\cb3 deserve one but realistically they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um if that makes any sense so\cb1 \
\cb3 um he even brings up examples of um\cb1 \
\cb3 younger women that he's around they want\cb1 \
\cb3 a birken only because they see their\cb1 \
\cb3 favorite celebrities with a birkin\cb1 \
\cb3 but they don't know how to treat a\cb1 \
\cb3 birken they think that they could walk\cb1 \
\cb3 into\cb1 \
\cb3 hermes and buy a birkin nope\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't do that yeah you can't and he\cb1 \
\cb3 buys hermes like either fragrances their\cb1 \
\cb3 shoes whatnot\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah like he doesn't like he knows that\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't understand and i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 it's kind of um\cb1 \
\cb3 it's something like younger women\cb1 \
\cb3 unfortunately don't appreciate\cb1 \
\cb3 handmade high quality designer items\cb1 \
\cb3 and i feel like because it's been so\cb1 \
\cb3 popular they think that\cb1 \
\cb3 they could just get one\cb1 \
\cb3 so well okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 how old are you i'm 25. all right\cb1 \
\cb3 what blows my mind is i'm listening to\cb1 \
\cb3 25 year olds even have a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 about a bag that's 40 000\cb1 \
\cb3 a bag that costs more than most cars\cb1 \
\cb3 that you guys can afford\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yeah for sure so i even say to my\cb1 \
\cb3 boyfriend i do not want one i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 me personally my boyfriend's a high\cb1 \
\cb3 value man\cb1 \

\cb3 deserve to have one\cb1 \
\cb3 unless i'm like you know pushing out his\cb1 \
\cb3 baby or something well yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i would never come to him and like oh\cb1 \

\cb3 living\cb1 \
\cb3 he works in tech so he invests in um\cb1 \
\cb3 startup companies um and he also helps\cb1 \
\cb3 build\cb1 \
\cb3 ops and he's also encrypted how did you\cb1 \
\cb3 say what\cb1 \
\cb3 uh he's 51 all right so he's a lot older\cb1 \
\cb3 than i am but i\cb1 \

\cb3 this um\cb1 \
\cb3 um do you respect homeboy uh it's time\cb1 \

\cb3 i'm just saying seven months if you if\cb1 \
\cb3 you've been together seven months\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you want to have if you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 have kids\cb1 \
\cb3 it should be more than a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 there should be some decisions being\cb1 \
\cb3 made\cb1 \
\cb3 in the next four\cb1 \
\cb3 uh four to five months just saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 um just putting it out there i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 in 51\cb1 \
\cb3 this is on you if you know what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know you are marriage and\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 and he's and he's got the resources and\cb1 \
\cb3 if you what he wants if he wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 or be with you\cb1 \
\cb3 and it or if he really likes you\cb1 \
\cb3 and but it's not there yet then the fair\cb1 \
\cb3 thing to do would be to say\cb1 \
\cb3 and let you go on about your business\cb1 \
\cb3 see the either\cb1 \
\cb3 you got to either cut bait or or you\cb1 \
\cb3 you do the other thing so that's just\cb1 \

\cb3 isn't here\cb1 \
\cb3 uh not until marriage then why are so\cb1 \
\cb3 many women today\cb1 \
\cb3 so preoccupied with what a man has\cb1 \
\cb3 if a man's money is not really a factor\cb1 \
\cb3 until you are his wife\cb1 \
\cb3 why do so many of you ladies are so into\cb1 \
\cb3 his\cb1 \
\cb3 are so big into his resources\cb1 \
\cb3 unless he's actively pursuing you for\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 why should what he's you know a case in\cb1 \
\cb3 point\cb1 \
\cb3 oftentimes you'll hear women talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that they're dating\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you're not dating him to any end\cb1 \
\cb3 what he does\cb1 \
\cb3 and his money is just what he's\cb1 \
\cb3 responsible to pay for the dates\cb1 \
\cb3 the dates and then\cb1 \
\cb3 if he chooses to buy you some stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 while the birthday or something\cb1 \
\cb3 well however our relationship but he's\cb1 \
\cb3 not supposed to pay your bills\cb1 \
\cb3 even a high value rich successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive am not supposed to pay your\cb1 \
\cb3 bills\cb1 \
\cb3 that's stuff reserved for wives and why\cb1 \
\cb3 is that so\cb1 \
\cb3 great why is that so hard for a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies to get\cb1 \
\cb3 because i will tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 i have had i've dated women who expected\cb1 \
\cb3 me to pay their bills\cb1 \
\cb3 and they were shocked when i said no\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm like no this goes on\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is before and this is not just\cb1 \
\cb3 a recent phenomena\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies if you're dating a successful man\cb1 \
\cb3 who who has\cb1 \
\cb3 who has a nice income that's his money\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want access to his resources you\cb1 \
\cb3 need his commitment\cb1 \
\cb3 now i'm sure they're going to be some\cb1 \
\cb3 women well but you want access to her\cb1 \
\cb3 body\cb1 \
\cb3 uh that's a silly argument\cb1 \
\cb3 the only way you can make that argument\cb1 \
\cb3 is if you're a virgin\cb1 \
\cb3 because automatically a man's gonna look\cb1 \
\cb3 at it and say wait a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 if you've had sex\cb1 \
\cb3 for without commitment of marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 already don't try to raise the price now\cb1 \
\cb3 that you're older\cb1 \
\cb3 see what a lot of you ladies are\cb1 \
\cb3 suffering from these days\cb1 \
\cb3 are the fact that with only fans and\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 online you know adult entertainment\cb1 \
\cb3 there is nothing really\cb1 \
\cb3 sacred or special anymore so what\cb1 \
\cb3 are you giving to the man that you want\cb1 \
\cb3 to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 that's special that makes him want to\cb1 \
\cb3 commit to you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not that men don't want to commit\cb1 \
\cb3 or get married or whatever it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you doing\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you doing chances she gave her\cb1 \
\cb3 body access\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm in no time\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so call in ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 the panel's open you call in ask a\cb1 \
\cb3 question here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 ask your questions ladies ask your\cb1 \
\cb3 questions\cb1 \
\cb3 why is this so hard for women to to to\cb1 \
\cb3 comprehend\cb1 \
\cb3 why do women today\cb1 \
\cb3 who for your commitment who run for\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you asking for so much more\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like it's backwards you're asking\cb1 \
\cb3 for stuff that\cb1 \
\cb3 is reserved for wives and serious\cb1 \
\cb3 committed relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 from people you're just hooking up with\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean am i missing something here\cb1 \
\cb3 am i missing something here why are you\cb1 \
\cb3 asking for a man to pay your bills\cb1 \
\cb3 while you're dating and\cb1 \
\cb3 would you feel some kind of way if you\cb1 \
\cb3 if he didn't if a man could pay your\cb1 \
\cb3 bills\cb1 \
\cb3 let's say let's say right now let's say\cb1 \
\cb3 we're going into this dark winter\cb1 \
\cb3 let's say you're dating a henry\cb1 \
\cb3 and you guys have just started you know\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in the you're in between the\cb1 \
\cb3 first first to the sixth month\cb1 \
\cb3 your car notes due\cb1 \
\cb3 your insurance is due you need help with\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 should he pay it you got a three\cb1 \
\cb3 you got a 300 bill should he pay it\cb1 \
\cb3 because i know i've heard many women say\cb1 \
\cb3 well why not dinner was our date was\cb1 \
\cb3 three hundred dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 but should he pay your 300 bill\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 mm-hmm\cb1 \
\cb3 i i personally think the man is\cb1 \
\cb3 impressed about money\cb1 \
\cb3 personally think that a man who is\cb1 \
\cb3 impressed about money won't have an\cb1 \
\cb3 issue helping this girl out or spoiling\cb1 \
\cb3 her\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 well let's flip it then miss brown\cb1 \
\cb3 should you pay his bill if a woman is\cb1 \
\cb3 not pressed about money\cb1 \
\cb3 should you pay your man's bill\cb1 \
\cb3 miss brown what do you think\cb1 \
\cb3 because i often hear women who think\cb1 \
\cb3 such\cb1 \
\cb3 so cavalierly about a man's money\cb1 \
\cb3 but whatever i told you gentlemen pay\cb1 \
\cb3 attention to where she puts her money\cb1 \
\cb3 if she doesn't put any money on you and\cb1 \
\cb3 invest anything in you\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention especially if she has\cb1 \
\cb3 expensive taste\cb1 \
\cb3 if she has expensive taste and she has\cb1 \
\cb3 nice things that means she has\cb1 \
\cb3 access to resources and she doesn't do\cb1 \
\cb3 anything for you\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention\cb1 \
\cb3 so what date cost 300 dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 uh are you serious an ecb\cb1 \
\cb3 is that a joke\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i'm not trying to be funny but\cb1 \
\cb3 nicie b said what date costs 300\cb1 \
\cb3 um let me go\cb1 \
\cb3 are you kidding\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so basically what miss brown is\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 is he's not pressure money so he should\cb1 \
\cb3 just be able to spend it well\cb1 \
\cb3 first question is why does he you should\cb1 \
\cb3 already pay your bills what if he wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 there who would pay it\cb1 \
\cb3 number one number two let's say you\cb1 \
\cb3 you do need let's say that's the wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 way to think about stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 you're spending his money and you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 his wife\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i understand you're thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 but things are missing in your thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 and i want you ladies to kind of talk\cb1 \
\cb3 through what's missing\cb1 \
\cb3 uh where did she go what date cost three\cb1 \
\cb3 hundred dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean seriously niecy what does she\cb1 \
\cb3 respond and say\cb1 \
\cb3 nicie b uh i'm not i'm not trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 roast you i'm just trying to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 if that was a serious question\cb1 \
\cb3 because i don't know if you're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 300 this\cb1 \
\cb3 is nothing or 300 is too much i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously um a good steakhouse\cb1 \
\cb3 you know you know like i like steak\cb1 \
\cb3 and i like cowboy ribeye a good\cb1 \
\cb3 a good cowboy ribeye is gonna cost you\cb1 \
\cb3 anywhere from 78 from six\cb1 \
\cb3 from 78 to 95 dollars that's just the\cb1 \
\cb3 stake\cb1 \
\cb3 my stake is anywhere from there's a 100\cb1 \
\cb3 bucks\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not and it doesn't come with any\cb1 \
\cb3 side items\cb1 \
\cb3 side items are 12 15 dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 300 on a date can happen real quickly\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're grown\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to show this just because you\cb1 \
\cb3 sound crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 coco writes i went on a date last night\cb1 \
\cb3 that was 300\cb1 \
\cb3 i wiped my ass at 300 that ain't [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 date better men uh i hope anybody dating\cb1 \
\cb3 coco\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you see that\cb1 \

\cb3 it's the way in which you're speaking\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm like wow\cb1 \
\cb3 bro wow\cb1 \
\cb3 so what it seems to me is though many\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 talk a good game um\cb1 \
\cb3 but when i was in new york i looked\cb1 \
\cb3 around and how many people were out on\cb1 \
\cb3 what looked like dates\cb1 \
\cb3 and i would say even in some of the\cb1 \
\cb3 nicest places i went to\cb1 \
\cb3 only about 25 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 of the people i looked around and seen\cb1 \
\cb3 look like they were on dates\cb1 \
\cb3 mostly just out for dinner\cb1 \
\cb3 so we'll be got to be honest and say\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies dating in general\cb1 \
\cb3 is taking a nosedive\cb1 \
\cb3 so you're expecting men to date\cb1 \
\cb3 date high-end pay your bills\cb1 \
\cb3 and all i'm asking is what are they\cb1 \
\cb3 getting why are you what\cb1 \
\cb3 what makes you group of women so special\cb1 \
\cb3 what made you better than\cb1 \
\cb3 the generations of women that came\cb1 \
\cb3 before you because the generations of\cb1 \
\cb3 women that came before you\cb1 \
\cb3 uh actually had skills\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the generations of women that\cb1 \
\cb3 came before you while they may not have\cb1 \
\cb3 gone\cb1 \
\cb3 to college and had a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 the generations of women that came\cb1 \
\cb3 before you actually had you know\cb1 \
\cb3 a phd they didn't have a phd but the\cb1 \
\cb3 generations of women that came before\cb1 \

\cb3 all right\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll meet yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 first name\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you got\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about and um as far as the topic\cb1 \
\cb3 goes\cb1 \
\cb3 with real men paying the bills and\cb1 \
\cb3 buying birkins\cb1 \
\cb3 so it really to me\cb1 \
\cb3 is just game because a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 modern women who um\cb1 \
\cb3 who operate under the 50 50 paradigm\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know they uh they consider\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves to be independent woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who can pay their own bills pay their\cb1 \
\cb3 own way\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know the modern man is is\cb1 \
\cb3 expected to respect that\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know we do um but\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of women don't also realize that\cb1 \
\cb3 that is really playing into the part of\cb1 \
\cb3 the game\cb1 \
\cb3 that a certain section of men have\cb1 \
\cb3 flipped into their favor\cb1 \
\cb3 and so they're kind of flipping it back\cb1 \
\cb3 on them\cb1 \
\cb3 so and what i'm talking about you kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of you're kind of rambling man you're\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of rambling how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 25. all right that let it kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 explain\cb1 \
\cb3 and what are you out here dating are you\cb1 \
\cb3 out here actively dating\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i i own my own home outright i\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a i'm in a different situation\cb1 \
\cb3 so i can afford to go on dates okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 and so i've been out here so what made\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to what what drew you to watch\cb1 \
\cb3 shira7 and those the level up channels\cb1 \
\cb3 because it's an interesting perspective\cb1 \
\cb3 when i was seven because\cb1 \
\cb3 i learned the game through experience\cb1 \
\cb3 and um\cb1 \
\cb3 uh uh because i was one of these sumps\cb1 \
\cb3 out here\cb1 \
\cb3 and i was the one who was actually doing\cb1 \
\cb3 this i was paying\cb1 \
\cb3 you know and um because i had money you\cb1 \
\cb3 know i actually did\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i bought a girl a car and i put\cb1 \
\cb3 a girl in an apartment\cb1 \
\cb3 and um when did you buy a woman a car\cb1 \
\cb3 so this was when i was like 19. i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 ultimately those channels in my opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 they're fantasy okay they're fantasy\cb1 \
\cb3 they tell women what they want to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of like i looked at some of this\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff from\cb1 \
\cb3 you know derek jackson one of his videos\cb1 \
\cb3 popped up i'm actually going to make a\cb1 \
\cb3 response to it\cb1 \
\cb3 um they can tell these women anything\cb1 \
\cb3 they want to but can they get it\cb1 \
\cb3 uh and i have yet to see any of these\cb1 \
\cb3 women producing any results so\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean just sounds good um but go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 i got some more people joining him yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 uh really all i just wanted to say was i\cb1 \

\cb3 like females with phds to get um\cb1 \
\cb3 like high quality men like\cb1 \
\cb3 is it did i say it's hard yeah like i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know if that's like attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 for high quality men to say that you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 well i have women who are phds who call\cb1 \
\cb3 in this channel who are married\cb1 \
\cb3 successfully married what you've got\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is a man is not picking\cb1 \
\cb3 you because of your\cb1 \
\cb3 medical degree or your phd he's picking\cb1 \
\cb3 you because\cb1 \
\cb3 feminine fit cooperative childless and\cb1 \
\cb3 single\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i'm just trying to keep that in\cb1 \
\cb3 mind more because i'll see like my other\cb1 \
\cb3 um non-black female partners who are\cb1 \
\cb3 not so gun holed on their academics but\cb1 \
\cb3 more like\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know just focused on getting a\cb1 \
\cb3 man and\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel like i wonder if i should be like\cb1 \
\cb3 that or i don't know well do you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be married\cb1 \
\cb3 yes well yes then you need to focus on\cb1 \
\cb3 both\cb1 \
\cb3 because far too often women like\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 go focus solely on career and then you\cb1 \
\cb3 look up and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 30 years old and you have\cb1 \
\cb3 you've spent no time developing\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship or dating skills\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's hard to undo that\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean are these you know um\cb1 \
\cb3 there are women in medical school or\cb1 \
\cb3 going pre-med who get relationships in\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 so yeah do both life is hard\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right thanks all right thank\cb1 \

\cb3 i'm 30. all right what you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm 30 and i have two kids so i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 single i have two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm from a previous relationship um so i\cb1 \
\cb3 was kind of trying to rate myself but\cb1 \
\cb3 i am still like very like young active i\cb1 \
\cb3 have a lot to offer\cb1 \
\cb3 um i make great money i have good\cb1 \
\cb3 well-behaved children\cb1 \
\cb3 and i am in la dating and i just find\cb1 \
\cb3 dating in la so hard so i actually don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have like a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 like meeting like um what you call like\cb1 \
\cb3 high profile men like men\cb1 \
\cb3 she's got a problem getting a husband\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah but\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah cause you got two kids so it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 the two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 no it's not just it's not just it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 just it's big\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you're 30 years old and all this\cb1 \
\cb3 career stuff but where\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how many how many different fathers\cb1 \
\cb3 one\cb1 \
\cb3 okay how come how come you and he didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 get married i was so young\cb1 \
\cb3 when i was in that relationship so how\cb1 \
\cb3 does your oldest child\cb1 \
\cb3 10. i was your youngest\cb1 \
\cb3 seven so you were 23.\cb1 \
\cb3 when i had my daughter yeah so my kid's\cb1 \
\cb3 father he was older than me\cb1 \
\cb3 but listen what i'm about to say you\cb1 \
\cb3 were younger you were\cb1 \
\cb3 old enough to make babies first one\cb1 \
\cb3 at 20 even though i'm not okay with it\cb1 \
\cb3 you can let it slide but the second one\cb1 \
\cb3 man that's a choice\cb1 \
\cb3 why didn't you yeah no we were in the\cb1 \
\cb3 like i was with him for like\cb1 \
\cb3 six or seven years but you weren't his\cb1 \
\cb3 wife\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's now yeah so so\cb1 \
\cb3 if you let me explain it to you i'll try\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a woman that was with a man for\cb1 \
\cb3 six or seven years\cb1 \
\cb3 and you gave him the highest honor a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman can give any man on the planet\cb1 \
\cb3 you gave him children you gave him not\cb1 \
\cb3 only one you gave him two\cb1 \
\cb3 and yet you did not require him to even\cb1 \
\cb3 bestow the title of a wife\cb1 \
\cb3 upon you so you go back out into the\cb1 \
\cb3 market\cb1 \
\cb3 older with two children\cb1 \
\cb3 you and you expect someone in that\cb1 \
\cb3 market\cb1 \
\cb3 to accept you older and bestow the title\cb1 \
\cb3 of life upon you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what that's how men look at it\cb1 \
\cb3 right wrong or indifferent and then\cb1 \
\cb3 being in la\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most competitive markets for\cb1 \
\cb3 women in the world\cb1 \
\cb3 competition is stiff out there i'll be\cb1 \
\cb3 there in a couple of weeks\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful woman hey like so i\cb1 \
\cb3 do me i do meet great men i don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 it's hard\cb1 \
\cb3 finding the man okay man i admit it too\cb1 \
\cb3 oh no no no see this is how we judge\cb1 \
\cb3 over here\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't judge by dealing with dating we\cb1 \
\cb3 judging weddings\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the only thing that counts if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not married you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 see that makes it real clear because\cb1 \
\cb3 you've had\cb1 \
\cb3 everything up to that point anyway right\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been engaged right i don't count\cb1 \
\cb3 those either\cb1 \
\cb3 because women especially a lot of black\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 have been engaged for a long time three\cb1 \
\cb3 four five engagements see when you make\cb1 \
\cb3 it real clear\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a high value man or whatever you\cb1 \
\cb3 do whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 term you're using has any one of them\cb1 \
\cb3 marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the answer is no\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's what i say it's dif the\cb1 \
\cb3 dating market is difficult because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not an unattractive woman sure a\cb1 \
\cb3 guy will take you out for a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice date\cb1 \
\cb3 you really know what you really want to\cb1 \
\cb3 know what you think\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how tall are you i'm five six i weigh\cb1 \
\cb3 115 pounds\cb1 \
\cb3 yes okay i'll take you out i'll tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 i would take you out so i don't have a\cb1 \
\cb3 problem finding men\cb1 \
\cb3 of course not i wouldn't but the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 is but what do you find in the four\cb1 \
\cb3 though\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i would take you out take you out\cb1 \
\cb3 get you a nice steak and some lobster\cb1 \
\cb3 we'd have a good old time and i would\cb1 \
\cb3 blow your back\cb1 \
\cb3 out but i wouldn't marry you see what i\cb1 \
\cb3 think i really have an issue\cb1 \
\cb3 is like finding men that\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want like the superficial like\cb1 \
\cb3 most i feel like the type of guys like\cb1 \
\cb3 they just want a woman that like\cb1 \
\cb3 looks good on their arm like yes\cb1 \
\cb3 so like when you don't listen let me\cb1 \
\cb3 stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop\cb1 \
\cb3 stop\cb1 \
\cb3 stop right there yes that's what we want\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's who we are\cb1 \
\cb3 and you want a man that's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 but but listen listen listen listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen you want men not to be men\cb1 \
\cb3 you want men to think like women\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not what we value ma'am we want a\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful woman on our arm\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah that's the problem well\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're the problem i'm the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 yes you're the problem because i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 telling you what\cb1 \
\cb3 men want you've experienced what men\cb1 \
\cb3 want\cb1 \
\cb3 and you've got a problem with it that's\cb1 \
\cb3 your problem we're not going to change\cb1 \
\cb3 you're either going to get on board with\cb1 \
\cb3 it or you will die alone\cb1 \
\cb3 so what should i be looking for then\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly first you need to get down and\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 you have no leverage you have no\cb1 \
\cb3 leverage in this matter\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the men we control access to\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships you control access to sex\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to understand what a man that\cb1 \
\cb3 you would want\cb1 \
\cb3 what he would want in a girlfriend wife\cb1 \
\cb3 or significant other\cb1 \
\cb3 like a good like a good mother\cb1 \
\cb3 that changes from every man that changes\cb1 \
\cb3 from man to man\cb1 \
\cb3 where's your father oh i don't i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't grow up with a mother or a\cb1 \
\cb3 father all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 due respect you you you've you you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 seem to get\cb1 \
\cb3 that men judge the way we judge\cb1 \
\cb3 and yes like i said you have no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 getting men to pay you attention\cb1 \
\cb3 you've got no problem attracting men but\cb1 \
\cb3 getting a man to take you seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 and would you like to be married\cb1 \
\cb3 i would okay and that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're asking a man to become a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking me let's say you're asking\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 to come in and take care of one man's\cb1 \
\cb3 child\cb1 \
\cb3 a man's two children\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't create those it's all downside\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been a stepfather it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 horrible deal what about the men that\cb1 \
\cb3 have children of their own\cb1 \
\cb3 they want a stepmother\cb1 \
\cb3 well again you're still active\cb1 \
\cb3 okay listen i'll answer it see you still\cb1 \
\cb3 you're still speaking as if you have\cb1 \
\cb3 leverage in this thing and i'm trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 level set you\cb1 \
\cb3 even if i have children i got more\cb1 \
\cb3 options than you\cb1 \
\cb3 i can go find a woman with no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 because i can afford\cb1 \
\cb3 both of you if i can afford if i can\cb1 \
\cb3 afford to take care of you and your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 i can afford to take care of her and no\cb1 \
\cb3 kids\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah why would i pick you and your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 when i know your kids are\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to i'm not their father\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll never look at me as their father\cb1 \
\cb3 i got all the responsibility and none of\cb1 \
\cb3 the upside of being a biological father\cb1 \
\cb3 can i discipline those children like\cb1 \
\cb3 they were my own\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't need to discipline their\cb1 \
\cb3 brother i see that's your problem there\cb1 \
\cb3 you go right there\cb1 \
\cb3 she said they don't need this no okay\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why sh\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're in freaking sane if you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think children\cb1 \
\cb3 kids are not special they need\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline just like anyone else\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe you don't okay then this is the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem i don't need they don't need\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline so the answer is\cb1 \
\cb3 could i could i discipline the child\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 okay without without quit without you\cb1 \
\cb3 questioning me\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah if i'm like if i choose you as my\cb1 \
\cb3 partner like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm have complete trust in you okay\cb1 \
\cb3 could so i could so\cb1 \
\cb3 i could spank the children attend they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need spanked\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no i could spank that see see\cb1 \
\cb3 right there i said i could discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 children you said yes\cb1 \
\cb3 pay your attention woman i am\cb1 \
\cb3 you said i could discipline the children\cb1 \
\cb3 without you questioning me\cb1 \
\cb3 yes so if i decide to spank them i got\cb1 \
\cb3 to listen to your mouth\cb1 \
\cb3 because they don't need it that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to stay single until your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 are gone\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the choice you made when you\cb1 \
\cb3 reproduced ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 and i need you ladies to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something you going out here having\cb1 \
\cb3 babies without marriage and then\cb1 \
\cb3 breaking up with men\cb1 \
\cb3 you incur consequences we don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 those kids around us because we cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 take care of them\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot discipline them we don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 put up with all this other stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a fun woman guys look at you and\cb1 \
\cb3 be like she's got two kids and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 5 6 115. she's a lot of fun she's\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously\cb1 \
\cb3 sexually active i'll have a good time\cb1 \
\cb3 with you but no way\cb1 \
\cb3 god not no not no way but very unlikely\cb1 \
\cb3 the man is going to take you seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 especially when you start talking\cb1 \
\cb3 because i believe what you're telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 is honestly and i'm like who wants this\cb1 \
\cb3 deal\cb1 \
\cb3 who doesn't want this deal a beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that is a great mother has a great\cb1 \
\cb3 career\cb1 \

\cb3 kids\cb1 \

\cb3 saying does not overcome the deficit\cb1 \
\cb3 that two children bring\cb1 \
\cb3 if you if i mean like you have money\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't matter to you\cb1 \
\cb3 i said you have money that doesn't\cb1 \

\cb3 trying to help you lady\cb1 \

\cb3 you're saying you all sit down for the\cb1 \
\cb3 next like\cb1 \
\cb3 eight years but you're not okay and who\cb1 \

\cb3 to be their wife\cb1 \
\cb3 i've got options i just i don't really\cb1 \

\cb3 no no that would be a fiance\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is where the truth comes in you\cb1 \
\cb3 can either\cb1 \
\cb3 man you don't have these kind of options\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm trying to explain okay then you\cb1 \
\cb3 wouldn't be here\cb1 \
\cb3 if you actually had options of the kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of the kind and caliber of men\cb1 \
\cb3 that you want then they were really\cb1 \
\cb3 considering you to be\cb1 \
\cb3 their wife you wouldn't be here right\cb1 \
\cb3 now\cb1 \
\cb3 i know i'm i'm just kind of like\cb1 \
\cb3 learning about\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i'm new here so i've this is\cb1 \
\cb3 literally like my first time like really\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is ma'am you're still a on\cb1 \
\cb3 your baby mama of\cb1 \
\cb3 two and\cb1 \
\cb3 are you telling me you're dating someone\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i yeah i i always have options\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to ask you one more time and\cb1 \
\cb3 if you are vague i'm going to bid you a\cb1 \
\cb3 good night\cb1 \
\cb3 just asking you are you dating someone\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah how long have you guys been seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 one another\cb1 \
\cb3 um it's been like two years two\cb1 \
\cb3 years has he expressed\cb1 \
\cb3 any desire to make you his wife\cb1 \
\cb3 yes has he taken you ring shopping in\cb1 \
\cb3 the last\cb1 \
\cb3 two years we've been ring shopping yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 when about three months ago\cb1 \
\cb3 three months ago\cb1 \
\cb3 but i just think the guy that\cb1 \
\cb3 like really just like sparks like\cb1 \
\cb3 my i don't know it just doesn't feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 someone i want to be with forever so\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's so i go back to the first\cb1 \
\cb3 thing i\cb1 \
\cb3 asked you are you telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 you are seeing someone then they're\cb1 \
\cb3 the man who's actually considering you\cb1 \
\cb3 is the man you want to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 and you said i've got options and you\cb1 \
\cb3 just went through this\cb1 \
\cb3 convoluted way of getting back down to i\cb1 \
\cb3 got somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 playing my love life well well no ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 what it is is it's hard for you to deal\cb1 \
\cb3 with the truth what it is is\cb1 \
\cb3 one you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that you want considering you\cb1 \
\cb3 to be his wife you got a man that you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 who sounds like he would take you but\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to marry him\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why it's been two years\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why you're on here trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 figure it out and i'm only trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 help you but it seems like you'd rather\cb1 \
\cb3 argue\cb1 \
\cb3 or be right than listen no i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to argue\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well then i need you to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that your children are a massive\cb1 \
\cb3 impediment how about this would you like\cb1 \
\cb3 to have additional children\cb1 \
\cb3 i would how many\cb1 \
\cb3 oh maybe two one to two so let's say you\cb1 \
\cb3 and i were to get married okay\cb1 \
\cb3 what you automatically set up is you get\cb1 \
\cb3 pregnant on our wedding night and you\cb1 \
\cb3 get preg\cb1 \
\cb3 you give birth to kevin junior then a\cb1 \
\cb3 year or\cb1 \
\cb3 a year after that you give birth to kim\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin and kim are my biological children\cb1 \
\cb3 with you right\cb1 \
\cb3 okay then i still have to take care of\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 two other children right so we have four\cb1 \
\cb3 four kids in the house\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah kevin and kim are mine\cb1 \
\cb3 if i decide to spank kevin you can't say\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] to me because he's mine\cb1 \
\cb3 biologically\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't tell me listen okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to sit there and zip your\cb1 \
\cb3 mouth and let me get through the example\cb1 \
\cb3 before you say something can you do that\cb1 \
\cb3 give me a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin and cam are mine they're my\cb1 \
\cb3 financial responsibility and you cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 pull the mommy card on me because\cb1 \
\cb3 biologically you can't you can't one-up\cb1 \
\cb3 me you can't play the high\cb1 \
\cb3 joker you can't say these are those\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 but when it comes to your children\cb1 \
\cb3 they're your children\cb1 \
\cb3 i've got to discipline them in line with\cb1 \
\cb3 what you\cb1 \
\cb3 think is right so i got two kid two sets\cb1 \
\cb3 of kids in the house under two sets of\cb1 \
\cb3 rules\cb1 \
\cb3 that's madness i've seen it\cb1 \
\cb3 no one men don't want that ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 can you understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the problem with being a having\cb1 \
\cb3 children already\cb1 \
\cb3 because you would have two kids by me\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids over here\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet if they want to go to college\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm still supposed to pay for it\cb1 \
\cb3 if your children want to go to college i\cb1 \
\cb3 still i got to put a roof over their\cb1 \
\cb3 head\cb1 \
\cb3 food in their bellies and provide for\cb1 \
\cb3 them just like i was providing for kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 and kim\cb1 \
\cb3 except kevin and kim let's say you and i\cb1 \
\cb3 divorced\cb1 \
\cb3 and kim are mine i still got visitation\cb1 \
\cb3 do i necessarily have anything with\cb1 \
\cb3 those kids if you decide not to\cb1 \
\cb3 let me see my step kids you could cut\cb1 \
\cb3 that bond\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies never think of it from a\cb1 \
\cb3 man's side it's all what\cb1 \
\cb3 you want and like you said you want a\cb1 \
\cb3 man to not be into all this superficial\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff another\cb1 \
\cb3 which means you really don't give a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 what we\cb1 \
\cb3 think we're just supposed to come in and\cb1 \
\cb3 do what you need\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fine but you better be offering a\cb1 \
\cb3 hell of a deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and now you have to hear that only cause\cb1 \
\cb3 of the kids\cb1 \
\cb3 well the kids are big man they are big\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean here's the thing you do have the\cb1 \
\cb3 option\cb1 \
\cb3 because you say only cause of the kids\cb1 \

\cb3 privilege\cb1 \
\cb3 she's used to getting by on her above\cb1 \
\cb3 average looks\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's got below average outcomes and\cb1 \
\cb3 no matter how i tried to talk to her\cb1 \
\cb3 she's going to sit there and stamp her\cb1 \
\cb3 feet because\cb1 \

\cb3 it but like the little petulant child\cb1 \
\cb3 you are\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna have your way that is why\cb1 \
\cb3 you are unfreaking\cb1 \
\cb3 fit for a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 you picked a deadbeat\cb1 \
\cb3 you sat there lying about being\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody's\cb1 \
\cb3 therapy i let that go on\cb1 \
\cb3 because i need you ladies to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what's\cb1 \
\cb3 up that's what's out here that woman had\cb1 \
\cb3 no\cb1 \
\cb3 concept of what a man would want\cb1 \
\cb3 all it was was men shouldn't be this way\cb1 \
\cb3 men shouldn't be that way then go get a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll go buy a dog\cb1 \
\cb3 well he would want a loving partner and\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody to be there\cb1 \
\cb3 are you that no well he would want a\cb1 \
\cb3 good housewife to take her\cb1 \
\cb3 was your mother and father married no\cb1 \
\cb3 then you weren't worried to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife no\cb1 \
\cb3 so now the housewife well no but i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 give up on the hope that i could be\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you could also be an olympic\cb1 \
\cb3 athlete too you're not gonna give up on\cb1 \
\cb3 that hope\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah it's time to stop hoping it's time\cb1 \
\cb3 to start\cb1 \
\cb3 getting adjusted to reality\cb1 \
\cb3 it's time to put some of these foolish\cb1 \
\cb3 hopes\cb1 \
\cb3 up fantasy\cb1 \
\cb3 you hear well could i discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 the children sure without having to\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to you\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah even well they wouldn't need a\cb1 \
\cb3 weapon\cb1 \
\cb3 they would need this they wouldn't need\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 man i got news for you you want men to\cb1 \
\cb3 not be so superficial\cb1 \
\cb3 based on the conversation we had that's\cb1 \
\cb3 all you have to bring to the table\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not i'll say oh that's the highest\cb1 \
\cb3 of the\cb1 \
\cb3 your your selling effect that's it\cb1 \
\cb3 because your your history your past\cb1 \
\cb3 dad child's father\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you guys can go back and listen\cb1 \
\cb3 to it\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's what you get lady\cb1 \
\cb3 and i tell you one more thing she could\cb1 \
\cb3 hear me speaking\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact of the matter she was triggered\cb1 \
\cb3 and when the reality starts setting in\cb1 \
\cb3 then that whole\cb1 \
\cb3 sugary sweet thing started to become\cb1 \
\cb3 more passive aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 and sorry man just because you didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 use the word you're still\cb1 \
\cb3 being that rude should not have to tell\cb1 \
\cb3 a grown woman\cb1 \
\cb3 to stop over talking me\cb1 \
\cb3 all righty then so\cb1 \
\cb3 ah let's see\cb1 \
\cb3 she thinks you did something well you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have to say well all you gotta do\cb1 \
\cb3 is\cb1 \
\cb3 stop\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies russo\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't really think you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 understand how\cb1 \
\cb3 much having children impacts your\cb1 \
\cb3 ability\cb1 \
\cb3 to get with somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 how many times you've heard a woman say\cb1 \
\cb3 well just because of the kids\cb1 \
\cb3 just because of the kids yes man because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not supposed to be out here\cb1 \
\cb3 you're supposed to be with the man you\cb1 \
\cb3 made those children with\cb1 \
\cb3 until death do you part see how it's\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to work\cb1 \
\cb3 you educated phd i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 this is how it's supposed to work you're\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to go out and have all your fun\cb1 \
\cb3 ride the carousel\cb1 \
\cb3 have hot girls summer do all the things\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to have\cb1 \
\cb3 make bad decisions or whatever then\cb1 \
\cb3 you're supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 pick or get picked by a man choose a man\cb1 \
\cb3 be chosen by man\cb1 \
\cb3 and you get with him\cb1 \
\cb3 then you marry state-sponsored marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever you call it\cb1 \
\cb3 this until death do us part\cb1 \
\cb3 and then you start having offsprings\cb1 \
\cb3 from that\cb1 \
\cb3 but you're not supposed to leave this\cb1 \
\cb3 only in cases of dire emergency meaning\cb1 \
\cb3 extremely abusive\cb1 \
\cb3 rampant uh unrepentant adultery\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff that's going to endanger your life\cb1 \
\cb3 for you or your children\cb1 \
\cb3 not your happiness not irreconcilable\cb1 \
\cb3 differences we grew apart\cb1 \
\cb3 you're supposed to stay in this till you\cb1 \
\cb3 die\cb1 \
\cb3 because you have children coming out of\cb1 \
\cb3 this and no one\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to take on the responsibility of\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 man's family\cb1 \
\cb3 but so many of you women out here are\cb1 \
\cb3 walking around\cb1 \
\cb3 with another man's children thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can visit that upon guys out\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 well what about the guys who are who\cb1 \
\cb3 have children you a\cb1 \
\cb3 wouldn't they want to be a step dad not\cb1 \
\cb3 necessarily\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't want to deal with you\cb1 \
\cb3 especially having your children in the\cb1 \
\cb3 house they're kids\cb1 \
\cb3 too much\cb1 \
\cb3 and then dealing with a woman who lacks\cb1 \
\cb3 the ability to really get on the plans\cb1 \
\cb3 program or be cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd rather just go get a 25 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 with none of that\cb1 \
\cb3 so uh\cb1 \
\cb3 that was a good call because i knew at\cb1 \
\cb3 some point it was going to go off the\cb1 \
\cb3 rails\cb1 \
\cb3 because when the reality of life the\cb1 \
\cb3 reality of our situation started to set\cb1 \
\cb3 in that man you are you had a baby at 20\cb1 \
\cb3 and another at 23.\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever is going on in your family life\cb1 \
\cb3 your upbringing\cb1 \
\cb3 seek therapy i recommend it to everybody\cb1 \
\cb3 you need it would be good idea to get\cb1 \
\cb3 that under control\cb1 \
\cb3 so you can at least start making better\cb1 \
\cb3 decisions but at the\cb1 \
\cb3 on the other end men are who we are you\cb1 \
\cb3 want us to not pick you based upon\cb1 \
\cb3 superficial stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 that's us\cb1 \
\cb3 and like i said there are plenty of men\cb1 \
\cb3 to be like oh yeah i would take a little\cb1 \
\cb3 five foot six 115 pounds self\cb1 \
\cb3 out a little cute mm-hmm yeah you can\cb1 \
\cb3 give it a steak\cb1 \
\cb3 get out of the blue crab claw get it\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever because i'ma break\cb1 \
\cb3 your back and i'm gonna send you back to\cb1 \
\cb3 your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 mm-hmm and we do it again next week\cb1 \
\cb3 because you ain't staying at my house\cb1 \
\cb3 you got to go back to them kids\cb1 \
\cb3 even more serious than a dog\cb1 \
\cb3 am i lying gentlemen\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what guys think of when they see\cb1 \
\cb3 this thing on my home\cb1 \
\cb3 of two what you gonna tell them\cb1 \
\cb3 well you gotta wait three months you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to take me on 12 days\cb1 \
\cb3 what you lucky i didn't take you to\cb1 \

\cb3 and for everybody who thinks yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 b-i-s-h\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a nice way of not cussing you out\cb1 \
\cb3 but if i rise to the level where i say\cb1 \
\cb3 that word you've earned it\cb1 \

\cb3 oh let's get the lights up\cb1 \
\cb3 guys ladies and gentlemen do me a favor\cb1 \

\cb3 keep the engagement level over 50 that's\cb1 \
\cb3 not hard to do\cb1 \
\cb3 whether you're hitting a like or dislike\cb1 \
\cb3 it doesn't really matter\cb1 \
\cb3 it counts as engagement\cb1 \
\cb3 uh let me see\cb1 \
\cb3 oh here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 there we go\cb1 \
\cb3 in the chat room today we're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 something that i think is really\cb1 \
\cb3 important\cb1 \
\cb3 and something i can definitely say is\cb1 \
\cb3 missing\cb1 \
\cb3 with a lot of relationships a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 interaction between men and women today\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact of the matter is\cb1 \
\cb3 many women today simply just are not\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with their man\cb1 \
\cb3 in general or men in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies in the chat room do me a favor\cb1 \
\cb3 write down put a one in the chat room if\cb1 \
\cb3 you are or if you have ever been\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed addicted to the point to where\cb1 \
\cb3 you are\cb1 \
\cb3 craving a guy\cb1 \
\cb3 write it down in the chat room let us\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 and what's that what why is this\cb1 \
\cb3 important\cb1 \
\cb3 well as you're going to see\cb1 \
\cb3 when that key element is gone from the\cb1 \
\cb3 equation\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing is quite right today it's a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 today it's much easier to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh a lot of guys are far more into\cb1 \
\cb3 or far more in love with a far more\cb1 \
\cb3 craving or whatever their girlfriend\cb1 \
\cb3 wife's significant other than vice versa\cb1 \
\cb3 and when that happens there's gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 always be a problem and\cb1 \
\cb3 if you've ever been on that side before\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what it's like to be that blue\cb1 \
\cb3 pill beta male simp\cb1 \
\cb3 to where you know she calls you\cb1 \
\cb3 and you stuck on scent or whatever you\cb1 \
\cb3 you that dude that you're sitting there\cb1 \
\cb3 waiting for her to contact you back text\cb1 \
\cb3 you call you back\cb1 \
\cb3 and she don't hit you back and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 like well does she like me does she not\cb1 \
\cb3 like me\cb1 \
\cb3 well what's wrong i mean the last time\cb1 \
\cb3 she sent me a message i i responded lol\cb1 \
\cb3 and i put the smiley face but the smiley\cb1 \
\cb3 face didn't have the tears on it\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you guys are moving in a way to\cb1 \
\cb3 where\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly she know\cb1 \
\cb3 she has you she knows she's the best\cb1 \
\cb3 thing going\cb1 \
\cb3 on in your life and you can't do any\cb1 \
\cb3 better\cb1 \
\cb3 i've said it once i've said it twice let\cb1 \
\cb3 me say it three times\cb1 \
\cb3 give your woman the gift of being\cb1 \
\cb3 insecure give her the gift of being\cb1 \
\cb3 uncomfortable\cb1 \
\cb3 give her the gift\cb1 \
\cb3 of being a little bit like i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 and let her act accordingly\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah shout out to uh yeah i got a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 women on youtube obsessed with the\cb1 \
\cb3 brother right now\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i don't oh yes i do you know i think\cb1 \
\cb3 it's funny\cb1 \
\cb3 that um there are some really\cb1 \
\cb3 nice women on youtube some attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 women on youtube\cb1 \
\cb3 who claim to not really care much about\cb1 \
\cb3 me or any of the stuff that i talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but yet you look at their shows you\cb1 \
\cb3 look at their content\cb1 \
\cb3 and uh they all talking about a brother\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean that's cool i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] i mean look at you and look at me i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 come on i mean let's see and we need to\cb1 \
\cb3 get to that point\cb1 \
\cb3 it's all right to be obsessed with the\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 i was going to play a clip from a movie\cb1 \
\cb3 in the 80s called\cb1 \
\cb3 fatal attraction glenn close\cb1 \
\cb3 glenn close plays the chara a character\cb1 \
\cb3 who was\cb1 \
\cb3 psycho she was crazy but she was\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with her\cb1 \
\cb3 lover and the thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 that is such a distant memory for so\cb1 \
\cb3 many of you women\cb1 \
\cb3 and for rightfully so i'm not going to\cb1 \
\cb3 go into why women are not obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 being today\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just going to say uh you would like\cb1 \
\cb3 to become a man that women are obsessed\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 she's they are obsessed with high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 she is obsessed with high value men why\cb1 \
\cb3 because high value men don't need them\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men may want them but don't\cb1 \
\cb3 need them\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why you want to give yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why you want to continue to\cb1 \
\cb3 improve\cb1 \
\cb3 and increase because you don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be in a situation with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that feels like she that you need her\cb1 \
\cb3 if you do o-m-g\cb1 \
\cb3 let me see maybe i'll play a little bit\cb1 \
\cb3 of that clip today let's go there was a\cb1 \
\cb3 podcast on\cb1 \
\cb3 and maybe i'll see if i can pull it up\cb1 \
\cb3 it was it was coming from the dead ass\cb1 \
\cb3 podcast\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's the ellis's and\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the whole notion this forced\cb1 \
\cb3 monogamy thing\cb1 \
\cb3 forced monogamy force monogamy forcement\cb1 \
\cb3 forced monogamy and in this podcast\cb1 \
\cb3 a man by the name of what is the ellis\cb1 \
\cb3 uh and his wife were sitting there\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 their relationship and i'm going to say\cb1 \
\cb3 that it was a not a very good look\cb1 \
\cb3 not a good look for the bro\cb1 \
\cb3 let's do it right here let's let's see a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman that's not obsessed with her man\cb1 \
\cb3 this is what it looks like when a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 is not obsessed\cb1 \
\cb3 with her man\cb1 \
\cb3 just a second you guys know i've been on\cb1 \
\cb3 the road a minute got to get the\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta get the uh\cb1 \
\cb3 cobwebs off so here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 dude where's the sound on this piece\cb1 \
\cb3 all right\cb1 \
\cb3 while we're doing this guys we need to\cb1 \
\cb3 get the likes\cb1 \
\cb3 up don't have me coming back to her\cb1 \
\cb3 asking you guys get the likes up when we\cb1 \
\cb3 get the show going\cb1 \
\cb3 because you guys complain when we turn\cb1 \
\cb3 the show\cb1 \
\cb3 her whole down up on her whole\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not it just a second\cb1 \
\cb3 so forced monogamy when you when you are\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with a woman who feels like\cb1 \
\cb3 being with you is a chore bro\cb1 \
\cb3 you got a problem when you are dealing\cb1 \
\cb3 with a woman who feels like\cb1 \
\cb3 being with you um\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not a pleasure for her guy you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 and make no mistake it is your problem\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot sit back and expect a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 to just be obsessed with your resources\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot expect her to be obsessed\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 your car your house\cb1 \
\cb3 any of this stuff any of your material\cb1 \
\cb3 possessions that's the bait\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the bait\cb1 \
\cb3 so these urges that come i have that's\cb1 \
\cb3 the bait\cb1 \
\cb3 based on our marriage laws and the the\cb1 \
\cb3 contract we signed with each other\cb1 \
\cb3 right to have sex with anybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 right so these urges that come\cb1 \
\cb3 i have to share them with the one person\cb1 \
\cb3 i decide to spend the rest of my life\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 right so that that brings me back to my\cb1 \
\cb3 my sound bite okay right i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 understand and this is what we can\cb1 \
\cb3 discuss\cb1 \
\cb3 as a woman because i don't i don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 to say it's a man versus woman thing\cb1 \
\cb3 but a lot of women do complain oh my\cb1 \
\cb3 husband's always on me why is he always\cb1 \
\cb3 on me\cb1 \
\cb3 if sex is going to be a chore for you\cb1 \
\cb3 that you don't really want to do\cb1 \
\cb3 why do women constantly push monogamy\cb1 \
\cb3 on men if you know that you don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 to have to deal with him all the time\cb1 \
\cb3 just wanting you\cb1 \
\cb3 why do you push monogamy on that well\cb1 \
\cb3 who's to say i pushed anything on\cb1 \
\cb3 anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 like what you're seeing right now is a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who's not obsessed with her man\cb1 \
\cb3 the question was posed all wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 if women want monogamy no women want\cb1 \
\cb3 monogamy\cb1 \
\cb3 from guys they want to screw women want\cb1 \
\cb3 monogamy for men that they are sexually\cb1 \
\cb3 attracted to and obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 women are obsessed with high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 and high value men have more than just\cb1 \
\cb3 money high value men have\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of things that keep women active\cb1 \
\cb3 money is just part of it\cb1 \
\cb3 money the length of time but again let's\cb1 \
\cb3 go over it you need to make a certain\cb1 \
\cb3 amount of money\cb1 \
\cb3 six figures or more for a length of time\cb1 \
\cb3 three to five years preferably closer to\cb1 \
\cb3 five years\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be acknowledged by other\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 that you are part of their group you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to have a network of other\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 and other people it needs to be visible\cb1 \
\cb3 linkedin level and it you need to be\cb1 \
\cb3 useful\cb1 \
\cb3 to others and the group see\cb1 \
\cb3 all that stuff gives women a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 to sink their teeth into if you just got\cb1 \
\cb3 the money and you don't have the rest of\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 you're gonna end up having issues like\cb1 \
\cb3 this guys having trying to explain\cb1 \
\cb3 why his wife no longer wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 have sex with him uh bro\cb1 \
\cb3 this is your problem your problem that\cb1 \
\cb3 you have not\cb1 \
\cb3 adequately stimulated her to get her to\cb1 \
\cb3 the point where she is craving\cb1 \
\cb3 you if you've i've been on both sides of\cb1 \
\cb3 this and i will tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 the side that he's on is the side of\cb1 \
\cb3 dying a slow death\cb1 \
\cb3 well we know that you pushed monogamy on\cb1 \
\cb3 me i pushed him out of you i forced you\cb1 \
\cb3 to get married to me\cb1 \
\cb3 time out i didn't say not just getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married but did you not say\cb1 \
\cb3 to me that you wanted to be engaged and\cb1 \
\cb3 you wanted to be married\cb1 \
\cb3 before you lived with me you didn't say\cb1 \
\cb3 that i want a million dollars that don't\cb1 \
\cb3 mean i'm gonna get it\cb1 \
\cb3 i can walk but did you not say\cb1 \
\cb3 the way he is asking these questions the\cb1 \
\cb3 way you're framing this stuff bro\cb1 \
\cb3 your wife has no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 passively aggressive dissing you\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressively dissing you\cb1 \
\cb3 she could take it or leave it\cb1 \
\cb3 and so many men today we were raised to\cb1 \
\cb3 be like this guy\cb1 \
\cb3 giving them everything they want how\cb1 \
\cb3 they want it\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the thing women don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 everything\cb1 \
\cb3 they want everything from the man they\cb1 \
\cb3 want\cb1 \
\cb3 that has to be their first see a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 you guys just think money looks money\cb1 \
\cb3 uh looks money uh status no\cb1 \
\cb3 it's from the guy she wants\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you don't understand how to get a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman addicted or\cb1 \
\cb3 to obsess with you there is nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 that is going to keep her attention\cb1 \
\cb3 locked loaded and focused on you\cb1 \
\cb3 longer than a cat is playing with a ball\cb1 \
\cb3 of yarn\cb1 \
\cb3 not you right now you're dodging the\cb1 \
\cb3 question nobody pressed you to do it yes\cb1 \
\cb3 is that something i wanted yes it was\cb1 \
\cb3 but you didn't impress me are you going\cb1 \
\cb3 to lie now to the people because we're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about sex\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to lie now to the people\cb1 \
\cb3 davao knowing\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't want monogamy of course i did\cb1 \
\cb3 so then why are you avoiding the\cb1 \
\cb3 question that's not avoiding the\cb1 \
\cb3 question i'm saying does that mean\cb1 \
\cb3 because i want it and i requested that\cb1 \
\cb3 that you were going to deliver it like\cb1 \
\cb3 nobody pressed you for that\cb1 \
\cb3 tomorrow you just said you wanted it and\cb1 \
\cb3 requested it do you not hear yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 i can make a request is the request\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be granted\cb1 \
\cb3 am i not am i not granting you monogamy\cb1 \
\cb3 you are granting it to\cb1 \
\cb3 so much stuff that hurts\cb1 \
\cb3 when you do when you have not\cb1 \
\cb3 and you don't if you're going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 one-on-one with the woman you better\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 you if you're going to be one-on-one\cb1 \
\cb3 with the woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you better understand what it takes to\cb1 \
\cb3 keep her attention\cb1 \
\cb3 locked to you\cb1 \
\cb3 because this is sad\cb1 \
\cb3 am i not granting you monogamy dude\cb1 \
\cb3 who cares if you're granting her\cb1 \
\cb3 monogamy as far as she is concerned\cb1 \
\cb3 she don't want to screw you she ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 worried about who else wants to screw\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 but the difference is when a woman is\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 she thinks everyone wants to screw him\cb1 \
\cb3 she thinks everyone is hinging on\cb1 \
\cb3 everything that he says everything that\cb1 \
\cb3 he says is interesting you can see how\cb1 \
\cb3 differently a woman who moves who's\cb1 \
\cb3 really\cb1 \
\cb3 into a guy whether he's into her or not\cb1 \
\cb3 is irrelevant\cb1 \
\cb3 you know they follow men that they're\cb1 \
\cb3 interested in\cb1 \
\cb3 they get tuned in first off we got uh 2\cb1 \
\cb3 500 people in here\cb1 \
\cb3 uh we need to get these likes up over\cb1 \
\cb3 1200 and we have\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you andre hatchet for coming on\cb1 \
\cb3 but we're gonna need at least five more\cb1 \
\cb3 people to drop something in here because\cb1 \
\cb3 come on man we got outside of andre we\cb1 \
\cb3 got one person that came in and put five\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars on come on man no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no no that's not how we do that\cb1 \
\cb3 if you guys want to do the show like we\cb1 \
\cb3 normally do it come on i forgot\cb1 \
\cb3 my bad what am i talking about you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 are used to me being on the road\cb1 \
\cb3 you're probably kind of throwed off a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit like oh he's back\cb1 \
\cb3 we got the show going on we're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 have interesting call in the back and\cb1 \
\cb3 forth dialogue i get it\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the little the little dollar sign\cb1 \
\cb3 there is where you get my attention you\cb1 \
\cb3 type your message in or just show some\cb1 \
\cb3 love right there\cb1 \
\cb3 or if you want to hit the cash app is\cb1 \
\cb3 dollar sign uh by kevin samuels that's\cb1 \
\cb3 how you do that\cb1 \
\cb3 but guys go ahead and uh spread the love\cb1 \
\cb3 show some love because here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 when you know what you're worth you\cb1 \
\cb3 won't accept less\cb1 \
\cb3 and see one of the things that so many\cb1 \
\cb3 of you guys are missing\cb1 \
\cb3 and this whole high value man thing high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 get high amounts of attention from women\cb1 \
\cb3 you guys are focused on sex sex\cb1 \
\cb3 is paramount to men attention is\cb1 \
\cb3 paramount to women\cb1 \
\cb3 you want her attention on you\cb1 \
\cb3 i.e obsession\cb1 \
\cb3 oh we can go when y'all go ahead and\cb1 \
\cb3 drop something in there\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to wes he said we're ready for\cb1 \
\cb3 the show man this is my question\cb1 \
\cb3 always look at the look at the boy look\cb1 \
\cb3 at you boy this is my question\cb1 \
\cb3 if you wanted monogamy okay why would\cb1 \
\cb3 you want monogamy if monogamy\cb1 \
\cb3 if if sex is a chore for you that's the\cb1 \
\cb3 question you're avoiding the question\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not avoiding the question but at\cb1 \
\cb3 first\cb1 \
\cb3 why would you want monogamy if sex is a\cb1 \
\cb3 chore for you\cb1 \
\cb3 bruh understand something that ain't a\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 for her that's a question for you\cb1 \
\cb3 why is sex a chore with you\cb1 \
\cb3 you better go do something with this\cb1 \
\cb3 because this is your woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and if sex is a chore with you then\cb1 \
\cb3 you seem to not understand how your\cb1 \
\cb3 particular woman is set up\cb1 \
\cb3 because sex is different for them yes\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a physical component but it's\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional first and mental\cb1 \
\cb3 and apparently she's not craving you\cb1 \
\cb3 she's not desiring you neil is the so\cb1 \
\cb3 how can she become obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 these are not questions for her these\cb1 \
\cb3 are questions for you\cb1 \
\cb3 you've lowered your value you've lowered\cb1 \
\cb3 her\cb1 \
\cb3 interest high value men high investment\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 high interest men you were not you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 man you're not in you're not a man worth\cb1 \
\cb3 investing in\cb1 \
\cb3 her precious little attention in energy\cb1 \
\cb3 stores she is giving them to everything\cb1 \
\cb3 other than you\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to get her attention her\cb1 \
\cb3 attention her interest is like your\cb1 \
\cb3 money\cb1 \
\cb3 and with it comes her body and\cb1 \
\cb3 everything else\cb1 \
\cb3 come on man you said me women or or in\cb1 \
\cb3 general me\cb1 \
\cb3 specifically are pushing monogamy on\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody okay yes that's something that\cb1 \
\cb3 i wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 but i didn't press you for it and be\cb1 \
\cb3 like developing the whole a gunshot had\cb1 \
\cb3 to propose\cb1 \
\cb3 so also let me finish also wow\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't feel like i was adequately\cb1 \
\cb3 prepared for marriage and i've said that\cb1 \
\cb3 before because if i knew that marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 and monogamy was going to involve me\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to meet you where you were at\cb1 \
\cb3 sexually for years to come\cb1 \
\cb3 then i probably would have reevaluated\cb1 \
\cb3 it if i wanted to be monogamous anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's fair but\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think he understood what she\cb1 \
\cb3 just said\cb1 \
\cb3 if i knew i was gonna have to have sex\cb1 \
\cb3 with your frequency\cb1 \
\cb3 uh and the consistency\cb1 \
\cb3 that you want to have sex with me i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know if i\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted that uh\cb1 \
\cb3 bro make no mistake\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the one the guys we cannot put\cb1 \
\cb3 off on the women\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever your woman's combination is you\cb1 \
\cb3 better go learn the combination\cb1 \
\cb3 now i'm not sitting this is where we\cb1 \
\cb3 have to\cb1 \
\cb3 determine was a lot of guys tend to\cb1 \
\cb3 follow a lot of you guys are selfish\cb1 \
\cb3 lovers\cb1 \
\cb3 and you bought too much into this this\cb1 \
\cb3 these rp stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 and thinking you're gonna get a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that you're one to one with\cb1 \
\cb3 to respond just because you pay the\cb1 \
\cb3 bills\cb1 \
\cb3 wrong bro one of your biggest complaints\cb1 \
\cb3 is she'll go\cb1 \
\cb3 smash a dude that ain't got a one one\cb1 \
\cb3 one one hundreds of what you have\cb1 \
\cb3 it's because he understands and can\cb1 \
\cb3 fulfill something that you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 he is getting her mind her interest\cb1 \
\cb3 her attention and this is not a logical\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 and to have this conversation in front\cb1 \
\cb3 of people i put this on you dude\cb1 \
\cb3 this is your wife you're a woman the\cb1 \
\cb3 mother of your children\cb1 \
\cb3 and i will tell you it is a choice\cb1 \
\cb3 you married a woman that was not\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 number one do not commit or become\cb1 \
\cb3 monogamous with a woman who was not\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with you she likes you she\cb1 \
\cb3 could love you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fine if she's not obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 you eventually she will bore of you\cb1 \
\cb3 do not do this to yourself homeboy\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not even even talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage let's even talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 dating right okay people are dating\cb1 \
\cb3 typically in society who asks for\cb1 \
\cb3 exclusivity first a woman or a man\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say a woman thank you that was\cb1 \
\cb3 my whole point see you were going all\cb1 \
\cb3 over the place if women\cb1 \
\cb3 typically ask for exclusivity first then\cb1 \
\cb3 when they get exclusivity say he always\cb1 \
\cb3 on me he always want to have sex\cb1 \
\cb3 why are we asking men for exclusivity if\cb1 \
\cb3 we do not want to participate except for\cb1 \
\cb3 in sex at the same level as men we have\cb1 \
\cb3 to think about\cb1 \
\cb3 what that does to a man and i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think that that's being\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all sound real childish bro\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about a woman with three kids and i\cb1 \
\cb3 will be the first one to tell you that i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand what you're trying to say\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are things that go that go on\cb1 \
\cb3 with a woman's body\cb1 \
\cb3 after childbirth after motherhood that i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't think you\cb1 \
\cb3 he doesn't seem to come across to me\cb1 \
\cb3 like a man who really understands\cb1 \
\cb3 how to be with one woman period and\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want all this access and\cb1 \
\cb3 everything else this is why you need to\cb1 \
\cb3 be 100 man\cb1 \
\cb3 all right she's got three kids and all\cb1 \
\cb3 this other kind of stuff uh then you\cb1 \
\cb3 better be living on your salary\cb1 \
\cb3 because if she has to get out there\cb1 \
\cb3 women are not built like us they can't\cb1 \
\cb3 go\cb1 \
\cb3 work 12 15 hour days and still come home\cb1 \
\cb3 and have\cb1 \
\cb3 rough and tumbled sex dude\cb1 \
\cb3 come on man you want all this from your\cb1 \
\cb3 wife this is why i asked\cb1 \
\cb3 the questions i ask of women and what do\cb1 \
\cb3 you hear them say\cb1 \
\cb3 most of them don't want to work because\cb1 \
\cb3 they're energy stores and they're\cb1 \
\cb3 they're built a different way\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why they're so obsessed with high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men because high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 can provide women the ability to be\cb1 \
\cb3 women easier than you 50 50\cb1 \
\cb3 uh equality dudes\cb1 \
\cb3 now i'm not trying to say every guy\cb1 \
\cb3 needs to go out and make a million\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars but you got to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 women are not going to change\cb1 \
\cb3 just because the modern dating landscape\cb1 \
\cb3 is what it is today\cb1 \
\cb3 human beings are what we are and they\cb1 \
\cb3 will be that way\cb1 \
\cb3 after we die your kids die we've evolved\cb1 \
\cb3 this way over\cb1 \
\cb3 over hundreds of thousands of years we\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't changing in your lifetime\cb1 \
\cb3 that conversation is being had okay i\cb1 \
\cb3 agree and that part i agree with yes\cb1 \
\cb3 that women are typically the ones that\cb1 \
\cb3 will ask for the exclusivity i get that\cb1 \
\cb3 yes\cb1 \
\cb3 but what i'm saying is me as a woman i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't think that i was necessarily\cb1 \
\cb3 prepared or in the mindset to know that\cb1 \
\cb3 it's almost like\cb1 \
\cb3 once you get into it then you're like oh\cb1 \
\cb3 shoot like this is what i'm going to\cb1 \
\cb3 have to keep up with\cb1 \
\cb3 us speaking as 36 year old people know\cb1 \
\cb3 that now had i known that at 26.\cb1 \
\cb3 i get that i would have to contend with\cb1 \
\cb3 that even in the dating realm\cb1 \
\cb3 then it might have been something i\cb1 \
\cb3 would have reevaluated so now let's go\cb1 \
\cb3 back to what you asked me you said to me\cb1 \
\cb3 you never pressured me\cb1 \
\cb3 to get married in 2007 we were living\cb1 \
\cb3 together right\cb1 \
\cb3 you said you no longer wanted to live up\cb1 \
\cb3 with me and shack up with me\cb1 \
\cb3 because you wanted to be my wife not my\cb1 \
\cb3 girlfriend right because i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 know where that don't sound like\cb1 \
\cb3 pressure to you it sounds like me\cb1 \
\cb3 voicing where i see my life going\cb1 \
\cb3 it sounds like me saying this is what i\cb1 \
\cb3 would like you can decide to meet me\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 if not we can reevaluate what exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 we're doing okay\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you guys in the chat room are\cb1 \
\cb3 saying he needs to do this he needs to\cb1 \
\cb3 do it he can't do any of that stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 he does not have the standing with her\cb1 \
\cb3 who in this relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 sounds like they are obsessed with the\cb1 \
\cb3 other\cb1 \
\cb3 who's in this relationship sounds like\cb1 \
\cb3 they could walk\cb1 \
\cb3 and not be pressed gentlemen\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be in a position where you\cb1 \
\cb3 can walk\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies understand to come up on the\cb1 \
\cb3 other side because i know there's some\cb1 \
\cb3 women gonna be like wait a minute whoa\cb1 \
\cb3 whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on that's to your advantage to be\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with your man oh yes\cb1 \
\cb3 i always bring it home\cb1 \
\cb3 he gave her everything that she said she\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted except the main thing\cb1 \
\cb3 a man with a backbone\cb1 \
\cb3 and an understanding of how to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand what his woman\cb1 \
\cb3 mentally needs\cb1 \
\cb3 call it pressure per se not necessarily\cb1 \
\cb3 pressure\cb1 \
\cb3 hey bro for me to you\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't ever do that [ __ ] again\cb1 \
\cb3 the [ __ ] are you doing you make all\cb1 \
\cb3 black men look man\cb1 \
\cb3 you're already losing\cb1 \
\cb3 in a back and forth debate with your\cb1 \
\cb3 wife in front of everybody\cb1 \
\cb3 then you want to take this passive\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressive was turning the goddamn\cb1 \
\cb3 camera off\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of doing this this is sad\cb1 \
\cb3 it is it is it is pressure but you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to say it's pressure\cb1 \
\cb3 what about being able to feel pressure\cb1 \
\cb3 what about being in the engagement\cb1 \
\cb3 behind it\cb1 \
\cb3 i said we don't got a rush to get\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 you said i don't want to be engaged\cb1 \
\cb3 longer than a year\cb1 \
\cb3 is that not pressure\cb1 \
\cb3 that's me voicing my opinion about it\cb1 \
\cb3 sounds like pressure to me so you say\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to be engaged i get engaged you\cb1 \
\cb3 say you want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 married within a year we do that we get\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 then you make it seem like like sex is a\cb1 \
\cb3 chore to your husband once again i\cb1 \
\cb3 asked what do you want homeboy\cb1 \
\cb3 all we've heard about is what she wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 and you gave it to her\cb1 \
\cb3 other than the things she really wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd prefer to tell her\cb1 \
\cb3 no for you to make her earn\cb1 \
\cb3 your attention for you to make her do\cb1 \
\cb3 something to get your whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 you men we have been told to give women\cb1 \
\cb3 what they want in my generation we're\cb1 \
\cb3 told\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll pay your rent i'll buy your shoes\cb1 \
\cb3 that look women women don't\cb1 \
\cb3 they want that but they want it from the\cb1 \
\cb3 from the right kind of men\cb1 \
\cb3 not this i'll give you everything so his\cb1 \
\cb3 problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 he's giving her everything that she says\cb1 \
\cb3 she wants he's thinking he instead of\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 if i give you all this i'm gonna get\cb1 \
\cb3 that no he's counting he's keeping score\cb1 \
\cb3 and giving her all this stuff and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 just like uh whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 bro better to invest your time in\cb1 \
\cb3 becoming the kind of man she wants to do\cb1 \
\cb3 all these things for\cb1 \
\cb3 all you guys in the chat room talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about he needs to do this he needs to do\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh look i think y'all need to back down\cb1 \
\cb3 too\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a big difference between dating\cb1 \
\cb3 and relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 huge you can get we had this debate back\cb1 \
\cb3 and forth on donovan show the other day\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a big difference you can get out\cb1 \
\cb3 here and slay a hundred women\cb1 \
\cb3 and still be horrible in relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships are one-to-one\cb1 \
\cb3 and people want an investment they want\cb1 \
\cb3 to return on their investment\cb1 \
\cb3 far too many men we don't get we don't\cb1 \
\cb3 take the time to get\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman obsessed invested\cb1 \
\cb3 requiring something and then are upset\cb1 \
\cb3 when they act like\cb1 \
\cb3 women they're supposed to be this way\cb1 \
\cb3 he wants her to be logical like a man\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm sorry that's your job holmes\cb1 \
\cb3 you should have gotten your woman\cb1 \
\cb3 addicted to you\cb1 \
\cb3 before you made her your woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you should have taken the time to get\cb1 \
\cb3 her obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 before you got down this path and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to talk about it in a western\cb1 \
\cb3 sense\cb1 \
\cb3 even from a pre-arranged marriage sense\cb1 \
\cb3 the question why do women\cb1 \
\cb3 who push forth monogamy on the man\cb1 \
\cb3 they're dating\cb1 \
\cb3 then get overwhelmed when that man who\cb1 \
\cb3 tries to provide that monogamy to you\cb1 \
\cb3 why do you get upset when we're trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to be what you want us to be you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want me to be with no one else right\cb1 \
\cb3 right i'm asking this is a serious\cb1 \
\cb3 question you don't want me to be with no\cb1 \
\cb3 one else absolutely\cb1 \
\cb3 so did all this testosterone i have i\cb1 \
\cb3 want to give to you\cb1 \
\cb3 why is this so overwhelming now this is\cb1 \
\cb3 what you asked for\cb1 \
\cb3 again 26 and 27 year old kadeen\cb1 \
\cb3 was like okay here's the natural\cb1 \
\cb3 succession of life\cb1 \
\cb3 you graduate you're working you meet\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 you guys are dating you want children\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i want children yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 who's leading this relationship who's\cb1 \
\cb3 leading\cb1 \
\cb3 you keep saying well uh\cb1 \
\cb3 you want this and now i want to give\cb1 \
\cb3 this to you yeah but she doesn't like\cb1 \
\cb3 the way you give it to her\cb1 \
\cb3 and what are you going to do you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to win an argument here\cb1 \
\cb3 when through your actions not an\cb1 \
\cb3 argument gentlemen\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're going to deal with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 one-to-one you better do what it takes\cb1 \
\cb3 to get her addicted or obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 to where you become the focal point of\cb1 \
\cb3 her attention because\cb1 \
\cb3 they're wired to be obsessed or to their\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 women today are more likely to be\cb1 \
\cb3 addicted or obsessed to their dogs\cb1 \
\cb3 their kids their friends but they can\cb1 \
\cb3 take or leave you\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to be the kind of man she's\cb1 \
\cb3 addicted to obsessed with the kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 man she wants to cheat with\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you can't stay away from\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships with women\cb1 \
\cb3 because the you can be a billionaire and\cb1 \
\cb3 still end up in this position right here\cb1 \
\cb3 we don't want to wait too long or too\cb1 \
\cb3 late to have children no now a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 people are waiting until their 30s to\cb1 \
\cb3 have children and i understand why we\cb1 \
\cb3 and we at that time felt like well we're\cb1 \
\cb3 doing everything\cb1 \
\cb3 in this natural succession that the\cb1 \
\cb3 forces that be have given us this\cb1 \
\cb3 timeline\cb1 \
\cb3 however i did not realize that after\cb1 \
\cb3 having children\cb1 \
\cb3 after you know career changes all of the\cb1 \
\cb3 turbulences that we've been through in\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 that that was going to have a direct\cb1 \
\cb3 effect on my sex drive\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been this early on in my life\cb1 \
\cb3 i was like this guy blue pill beta male\cb1 \
\cb3 simp\cb1 \
\cb3 raised on you know the eisley brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 and all these romantic songs and other\cb1 \
\cb3 things\cb1 \
\cb3 but we weren't those guys those guys\cb1 \
\cb3 moved a different way\cb1 \
\cb3 they sang those songs but they still had\cb1 \
\cb3 an old-school way of moving we\cb1 \
\cb3 got those songs but we had a new new\cb1 \
\cb3 school way of being programmed\cb1 \
\cb3 and moved in a soft way and ended up\cb1 \
\cb3 getting involved to one-to-one\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 and they failed this is why you never\cb1 \
\cb3 hear me\cb1 \
\cb3 talking poorly or negatively about women\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been with because even if i picked\cb1 \
\cb3 poorly it was still my\cb1 \
\cb3 my responsibility to lead through that\cb1 \
\cb3 thing see\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing it is far better to\cb1 \
\cb3 become a kind of man a woman wants to be\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 high value productive see productive\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful gets her\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 but a woman but a man that women find\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable or are men that women want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be with they're men that women want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be with\cb1 \
\cb3 their men that other women\cb1 \
\cb3 wish they could be with and they wish\cb1 \
\cb3 they were heard to have him\cb1 \
\cb3 so the production the competition the\cb1 \
\cb3 success is one component\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's the other things and it's the\cb1 \
\cb3 thing that you have here\cb1 \
\cb3 that actually is the thing that gets\cb1 \
\cb3 them kind of intrigued\cb1 \
\cb3 why because you move in a different way\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not pressed you're not sweating\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 and see when women started getting\cb1 \
\cb3 intrigued with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 attracted to a man obsessed with a man\cb1 \
\cb3 to the level\cb1 \
\cb3 of where she's addicted to they move in\cb1 \
\cb3 a completely different way\cb1 \
\cb3 he is all they see\cb1 \
\cb3 everything you could be talking if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're if you've ever been around a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman like this\cb1 \
\cb3 you're talking about anything oh well\cb1 \
\cb3 what'd you eat for dinner last night oh\cb1 \
\cb3 i had chicken chicken huh yeah uh-huh\cb1 \
\cb3 all right yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 cool well you know huh\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin i know you're tired of hearing\cb1 \
\cb3 about this guy but kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin used to love chicken it doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 matter\cb1 \
\cb3 they're always going to he's always\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be top of\cb1 \
\cb3 mind guys you need to be tom\cb1 \
\cb3 with your girl top of mind if you cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 stay top of mind with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 don't try to get involved in her one to\cb1 \
\cb3 one all these different\cb1 \
\cb3 uh tips and tricks and things like this\cb1 \
\cb3 are all to stay\cb1 \
\cb3 top of mind but in order to stay top of\cb1 \
\cb3 mind\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to understand her mind\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard a lot of stuff in these\cb1 \
\cb3 youtube streets it sounds real good\cb1 \
\cb3 but men who actually understand women\cb1 \
\cb3 and are willing to do what it takes\cb1 \
\cb3 have a different outcome when it comes\cb1 \
\cb3 to dealing with women\cb1 \
\cb3 one to one why is this important well\cb1 \
\cb3 when a woman's\cb1 \
\cb3 it is far better for a woman to be\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with a man than and what man to\cb1 \
\cb3 be obsessed with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 if a man is obsessed with a woman he\cb1 \
\cb3 lose he takes his eye off the prize he's\cb1 \
\cb3 nowhere close to being as productive\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or successful he gets in his\cb1 \
\cb3 emotions gets in his feelings\cb1 \
\cb3 he starts to make mistakes\cb1 \
\cb3 that has a deleterious effect on his\cb1 \
\cb3 outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 however when a woman's obsessed with man\cb1 \
\cb3 that man tends to have better outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why the eye is in fbi when a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman is obsessed with her man to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point where she's willing to\cb1 \
\cb3 be inspirational to him he has better\cb1 \
\cb3 outcomes and who benefits from those\cb1 \
\cb3 outcomes she does\cb1 \
\cb3 well wait a minute well wait a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody needs to\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody needs to love somebody more and\cb1 \
\cb3 gentlemen she needs to love you more\cb1 \
\cb3 than you love her\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a hard pill to swallow ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 but to the guys i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 gentlemen never get involved with a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who you need to love her more than\cb1 \
\cb3 she loves you\cb1 \
\cb3 and i know a lot of women have been told\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been told that he needs to love\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you more than you love him right and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why we have such a high divorce\cb1 \
\cb3 rate\cb1 \
\cb3 and women can end up walking away from\cb1 \
\cb3 marriages and relationships like this\cb1 \
\cb3 because they don't care\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's on you guys is she writing\cb1 \
\cb3 love letters to you\cb1 \
\cb3 i talked about love languages and\cb1 \
\cb3 options and all this other kind of stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're going to be out here dealing\cb1 \
\cb3 with them and this is\cb1 \
\cb3 all of them it's not just black women\cb1 \
\cb3 it's all of them\cb1 \

\cb3 of mind with her\cb1 \
\cb3 all women are this way so listen you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make black women some unique\cb1 \
\cb3 creature\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't think all women are this\cb1 \
\cb3 way you haven't you obviously have not\cb1 \
\cb3 had enough\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship experience with women and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's different than\cb1 \
\cb3 that's different than sex\cb1 \
\cb3 you can have a whole hell of a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 sex and be shitty at relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 but a man who keep a man who is a a man\cb1 \
\cb3 who women are addicted to or obsessed\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 the best thing you can tell a woman is\cb1 \
\cb3 no\cb1 \
\cb3 tell a woman no\cb1 \
\cb3 and watch what happens\cb1 \
\cb3 glenn close fail attraction told her no\cb1 \

\cb3 used to being told no\cb1 \
\cb3 for a man that they want\cb1 \
\cb3 and it doesn't matter who's in their\cb1 \
\cb3 life these women have\cb1 \
\cb3 other men around them at all times but\cb1 \
\cb3 all they want\cb1 \
\cb3 is the one they can't get\cb1 \
\cb3 gentlemen she's obsessed\cb1 \
\cb3 with high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 why because high value men value\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves enough\cb1 \
\cb3 to not be swayed by her beauty her booty\cb1 \
\cb3 or anything else\cb1 \
\cb3 you want it but you don't need it\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know by keeping your mind in the\cb1 \
\cb3 right position\cb1 \
\cb3 it's better for you and for her we have\cb1 \
\cb3 we have thirteen hundred people in here\cb1 \
\cb3 not even halfway done with the likes so\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 get the likes up we don't open the call\cb1 \
\cb3 line we don't move forward we don't do\cb1 \
\cb3 any of that\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you get a woman obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you get a woman obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 well one of the first things you need to\cb1 \
\cb3 learn how to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is understand the kind of women you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going after\cb1 \
\cb3 all women don't like the same things\cb1 \
\cb3 all women don't like the same things\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to learn your woman you have to\cb1 \
\cb3 learn what's valuable to her\cb1 \
\cb3 what's important to her\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i swear to god some of you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 now some of you guys are savages\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have any clue on how to be\cb1 \
\cb3 the most remotely smooth with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 see i'm looking at all you guys in the\cb1 \
\cb3 comment section you need money\cb1 \
\cb3 or stroke game or this or that little\cb1 \
\cb3 boys\cb1 \
\cb3 no those things matter\cb1 \
\cb3 but if all it took was money\cb1 \
\cb3 ah my my my\cb1 \
\cb3 while a lot of women may not understand\cb1 \
\cb3 me and it's really sad to realize how\cb1 \
\cb3 many you guys don't really understand\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 women want a man who can take charge in\cb1 \
\cb3 the world but behind the doors\cb1 \
\cb3 they want a man who can smooth that [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 out when it needs to be\cb1 \
\cb3 get rough when it needs to be\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all only got one or two speeds you're\cb1 \
\cb3 either all hard\cb1 \
\cb3 or all soft\cb1 \
\cb3 man can you can you seduce a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 can you seduce her mind because if you\cb1 \
\cb3 seduce her mind her body comes along\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll give that their body comes along\cb1 \
\cb3 willingly\cb1 \
\cb3 and there's a difference between a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who gives herself willingly to you\cb1 \
\cb3 versus a woman who lays there and gives\cb1 \
\cb3 you starfish sex\cb1 \
\cb3 and depending upon what kind of woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you want you have to do\cb1 \
\cb3 different things\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean now let's open the call line up\cb1 \
\cb3 um knowing how to be smooth\cb1 \
\cb3 works for me for the kind of women i\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't like a bunch of roughneck you\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 cave women i like a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 understands that this is candlelight\cb1 \
\cb3 i like a woman who understands what\cb1 \
\cb3 smooth jazz is i like a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 understands\cb1 \
\cb3 refinement the three archetypes which\cb1 \
\cb3 one are you\cb1 \
\cb3 refined rakish or rogue each one of\cb1 \
\cb3 those\cb1 \
\cb3 has a different seduction strategy\cb1 \
\cb3 but you learn how to seduce a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 before you ever touch her\cb1 \
\cb3 damn show before you ever have sex with\cb1 \
\cb3 her\cb1 \
\cb3 and many of you guys don't get it\cb1 \
\cb3 you're like this guy that i just showed\cb1 \
\cb3 and you are confused\cb1 \
\cb3 when you get a response from a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that she could take it or leave it\cb1 \
\cb3 because what you're offering ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 special\cb1 \
\cb3 what you what you're offering her\cb1 \
\cb3 what bernie mac 50 strokes calum if you\cb1 \
\cb3 had a time you're offering her 15\cb1 \
\cb3 minutes\cb1 \
\cb3 okay women today are well versed in\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding how to please themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you offering what are you\cb1 \
\cb3 giving her that she can't get anywhere\cb1 \
\cb3 else to where she should hold you in\cb1 \
\cb3 higher regard\cb1 \
\cb3 to where you don't have to ask questions\cb1 \
\cb3 this guy asked\cb1 \
\cb3 three kids in the chat room you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 that somebody was saying there's a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 with three kids who's working\cb1 \
\cb3 18 hours a day who's still\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with somebody maybe not the guy\cb1 \
\cb3 she's with\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's your problem if you're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to deal with a woman one to one\cb1 \
\cb3 you better learn how this works\cb1 \
\cb3 so truly high value men this is not\cb1 \
\cb3 something that\cb1 \
\cb3 makes you a high value man but a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 sure\cb1 \
\cb3 is in your in your favor a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 man is a man who can\cb1 \
\cb3 generate interest intrigue\cb1 \
\cb3 women find that valuable\cb1 \
\cb3 because to them attention matters\cb1 \
\cb3 can you keep her attention on you\cb1 \
\cb3 when there's a crying you want to have\cb1 \
\cb3 children great\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a crying baby in the other room\cb1 \
\cb3 oh man we going there tonight some of\cb1 \
\cb3 you guys never learned how to be\cb1 \
\cb3 uh like seductive there's a book called\cb1 \
\cb3 the art of seduction\cb1 \
\cb3 gentlemen it's right up there with the\cb1 \
\cb3 48 laws of power\cb1 \
\cb3 you must learn these things\cb1 \
\cb3 or you will continue to fail with women\cb1 \
\cb3 in relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 women hate boredom and a lot of you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 are boring\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you're with a woman that you have\cb1 \
\cb3 to do the kind of things this guy was\cb1 \
\cb3 doing\cb1 \
\cb3 he didn't start this way\cb1 \
\cb3 and i feel sorry for him because society\cb1 \
\cb3 has told\cb1 \
\cb3 him he did it he's a good guy and did\cb1 \
\cb3 everything the right way\cb1 \
\cb3 if he could have came through spaces\cb1 \
\cb3 like this\cb1 \
\cb3 he would have learned how to do things\cb1 \
\cb3 in a different way to where he would\cb1 \
\cb3 have been happier\cb1 \
\cb3 and she would have been happier\cb1 \
\cb3 now one of the other things is one of\cb1 \
\cb3 the\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the one of the things that many\cb1 \
\cb3 of you guys are missing\cb1 \
\cb3 to learn how to get a woman addicted to\cb1 \
\cb3 you obsessed with you is you need an\cb1 \
\cb3 older woman\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yeah i said it\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 but\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 many young men have never had your mrs\cb1 \
\cb3 robinson\cb1 \
\cb3 you never had your sugar mama you've\cb1 \
\cb3 never had that older woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who taught you how to stop having that\cb1 \
\cb3 jackrabbit sex\cb1 \
\cb3 to taught you what tantra is\cb1 \
\cb3 taught you that there's more to sex than\cb1 \
\cb3 intercourse\cb1 \
\cb3 taught you that a a woman's body\cb1 \
\cb3 is to be explored\cb1 \
\cb3 have you there's an anatomical thing\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a cerebral thing and what do you\cb1 \
\cb3 do with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who is a woman who's stimulated in her\cb1 \
\cb3 mind what if she's a\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it cepheophile\cb1 \
\cb3 do you even know your way around the\cb1 \
\cb3 genitalia\cb1 \
\cb3 can you identify the major parts\cb1 \
\cb3 down there guys like it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 they are different than we are\cb1 \
\cb3 and they move differently than we do and\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to argue with them logically is\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to change it\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want the outcomes you want\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to understand how to get this\cb1 \
\cb3 before you get that\cb1 \
\cb3 because you can get that make no mistake\cb1 \
\cb3 you can get that but if you get the head\cb1 \
\cb3 the everything else goes along with it\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies have you ever been\cb1 \
\cb3 addicted obsessed with the man\cb1 \
\cb3 how valuable was that man to you\cb1 \
\cb3 guys if you've ever had a woman addicted\cb1 \
\cb3 or obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 the sky's the limit\cb1 \
\cb3 very much a woman who's obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 the man is not willing to do\cb1 \
\cb3 they will fight for your attention even\cb1 \
\cb3 if you say\cb1 \
\cb3 it's over it's done these are the women\cb1 \
\cb3 who stalk you\cb1 \
\cb3 call your friends\cb1 \
\cb3 when a woman's obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 everything's about\cb1 \
\cb3 you they make videos about you\cb1 \
\cb3 on their instagram or to facebook\cb1 \
\cb3 hell even if they make videos on youtube\cb1 \
\cb3 they're supposed to be talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody else but they're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 you know it's all these double entendres\cb1 \
\cb3 like what are you really making a\cb1 \
\cb3 video about this or you talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 that guy you're obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 and one of the best ways to get women\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with you is do it before you\cb1 \
\cb3 touch\cb1 \
\cb3 them oh we are going there\cb1 \
\cb3 we are going there\cb1 \
\cb3 we are going there because that video\cb1 \
\cb3 was talking about forced monogamy and\cb1 \
\cb3 this and i'm like yeah i hear it\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh i don't i expect women to behave\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 women she did exactly what he allowed\cb1 \
\cb3 her to do\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to have a chance to fix a\cb1 \
\cb3 situation like that you got to leave it\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to leave it more often than not\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to leave it\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want to end up in that\cb1 \
\cb3 position don't start that way\cb1 \
\cb3 and understand something this is the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem that\cb1 \
\cb3 is at the center of many men's inability\cb1 \
\cb3 to keep a woman's interest in them\cb1 \
\cb3 keep a woman's interest firmly locked on\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's better for her it's better for you\cb1 \
\cb3 all right but you know maybe i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know what i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 i would i would run the risk that i do\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'll tell you what we're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 hear from the ladies\cb1 \

\cb3 many of you have never had a woman give\cb1 \
\cb3 a [ __ ] whether you're there or not\cb1 \

\cb3 but like i said if you've never had a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to be with you it's a different\cb1 \
\cb3 level\cb1 \
\cb3 and you can choose this thing you can\cb1 \
\cb3 get a woman who's there for the\cb1 \
\cb3 resources but then you get mad because\cb1 \
\cb3 she's there for the resources\cb1 \
\cb3 which is it guys do you not want to feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like she's there for the resources or do\cb1 \
\cb3 you want her to be there for you\cb1 \

\cb3 interested in you\cb1 \
\cb3 other women are interested in you she\cb1 \
\cb3 can see other women are interested in\cb1 \

\cb3 i actually by you explaining\cb1 \
\cb3 what obsessed and addicted by men is i\cb1 \
\cb3 i would consider myself currently\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed and addicted to a man\cb1 \
\cb3 okay what's the okay what's the\cb1 \
\cb3 difference between\cb1 \
\cb3 this guy what's the difference between\cb1 \
\cb3 how you're doing in this situation or\cb1 \
\cb3 how you felt in other situations\cb1 \
\cb3 well with this situation uh the genome\cb1 \
\cb3 is a lot older\cb1 \
\cb3 so he's also um a lot educated\cb1 \
\cb3 and um\cb1 \
\cb3 a gentleman that i was dating before\cb1 \
\cb3 they were\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot younger in their 30s\cb1 \
\cb3 and um\cb1 \
\cb3 they didn't really have an idea of what\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships was about in\cb1 \
\cb3 terms of high value and in terms of\cb1 \
\cb3 giving what do you mean it was always a\cb1 \
\cb3 want and um also it was\cb1 \
\cb3 all it was more like um\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're a kid and you imagine\cb1 \
\cb3 someone to be\cb1 \
\cb3 or to be a certain way you and imagine\cb1 \
\cb3 to marry a certain type of woman so a\cb1 \
\cb3 man would go after that particular type\cb1 \
\cb3 of woman\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but not have any understanding of\cb1 \
\cb3 how to get them\cb1 \
\cb3 so okay so you're saying that the men\cb1 \
\cb3 the men you're dealing with is older\cb1 \
\cb3 um the gentleman that i'm dating is\cb1 \
\cb3 older than me\cb1 \
\cb3 all right um so i'm trying to put it\cb1 \
\cb3 together for the audience\cb1 \
\cb3 um because i i know that older men\cb1 \
\cb3 typically move in a different way\cb1 \
\cb3 than younger guys do there's a there's a\cb1 \
\cb3 poise\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a level of there's a level of\cb1 \
\cb3 gravitas there's a level of\cb1 \
\cb3 a surety uh that comes with\cb1 \
\cb3 experience and wisdom um\cb1 \
\cb3 which i will say as an older man when i\cb1 \
\cb3 was younger\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't have those things and it was a\cb1 \
\cb3 hell of a lot easier for\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman to follow under that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 certainty\cb1 \
\cb3 is that what you're saying absolutely\cb1 \
\cb3 correct\cb1 \
\cb3 um all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what made you want to call in um i\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to call\cb1 \
\cb3 n because um i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 hear some perspectives this evening um\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been following your show for about\cb1 \
\cb3 like a couple of months now\cb1 \
\cb3 and um once i change my perspective\cb1 \
\cb3 on high value a lot of things have\cb1 \
\cb3 changed for me\cb1 \
\cb3 uh kev and uh the way i look at\cb1 \
\cb3 men and also the way i look at myself\cb1 \
\cb3 as a and as a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 so i appreciate that from you and um\cb1 \
\cb3 i also appreciate your honesty\cb1 \
\cb3 and putting things in perspective for us\cb1 \
\cb3 women and to be honest with you um\cb1 \
\cb3 especially for us black women and i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't i don't mean to\cb1 \
\cb3 uh get on that topic but to be honest\cb1 \
\cb3 with you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a community health activist and\cb1 \
\cb3 um i educate individuals on\cb1 \
\cb3 health and wellness and um\cb1 \
\cb3 one thing you talk about is you know\cb1 \
\cb3 weight size and obesity\cb1 \
\cb3 and the type of perspective of\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty much looking good right\cb1 \
\cb3 and being healthy of course\cb1 \
\cb3 so well um thanks for calling i'm glad\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 is starting to help because uh one\cb1 \
\cb3 i want women to understand that what\cb1 \
\cb3 they're asking for is a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're going to ask a lot you better\cb1 \
\cb3 deliver a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 um and i'm glad to see more women are\cb1 \
\cb3 finally starting to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 there is a value\cb1 \
\cb3 in actually delivering or giving to a\cb1 \
\cb3 man i gotta get you on to the next call\cb1 \
\cb3 i appreciate it\cb1 \
\cb3 kicking too guys understand something uh\cb1 \
\cb3 guys let's what people call in one thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't try to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is try to make younger guys feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not anything because you're\cb1 \
\cb3 younger life is different you should\cb1 \
\cb3 enjoy your 20s\cb1 \
\cb3 for different reasons you enjoy your 30s\cb1 \
\cb3 for different reasons you enjoy your 40s\cb1 \
\cb3 your 50s etc\cb1 \
\cb3 far too much of this stuff goes on\cb1 \
\cb3 especially in these mail spaces\cb1 \
\cb3 especially on blackmail youtube\cb1 \
\cb3 this ageism between men\cb1 \
\cb3 look that's stupid\cb1 \
\cb3 you should be moving differently in at\cb1 \
\cb3 40 versus 20.\cb1 \
\cb3 you're twice as old if you're moving the\cb1 \
\cb3 same way at 40 as you did at 20 you are\cb1 \
\cb3 a loser\cb1 \
\cb3 you have failed you have wasted 20 years\cb1 \
\cb3 and there's a reason why younger women\cb1 \
\cb3 tend to like older men\cb1 \
\cb3 worldwide it's natural\cb1 \
\cb3 the black community we prize youth\cb1 \
\cb3 because honestly this is where we see\cb1 \
\cb3 the most black male success\cb1 \
\cb3 in youth driven endeavors athletics and\cb1 \
\cb3 entertainment are\cb1 \
\cb3 youth driven endeavors and that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 you see the bulk of black\cb1 \
\cb3 money other places you see\cb1 \
\cb3 men prized in middle age\cb1 \
\cb3 because it's business\cb1 \
\cb3 older men are easy to please you\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my god\cb1 \
\cb3 some of you guys really should just not\cb1 \
\cb3 talk\cb1 \
\cb3 because you don't know what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 older men are easy to please no\cb1 \
\cb3 older men are direct\cb1 \
\cb3 and don't take any half positions let's\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and call in\cb1 \
\cb3 so and i get it a lot of a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 young men have a lot of young black men\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 father issues because you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say when i see a young brother\cb1 \
\cb3 they\cb1 \
\cb3 and they he wants to give me a\cb1 \
\cb3 compliment but he struggles\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to figure out what to say\cb1 \
\cb3 and this comes out something like this\cb1 \
\cb3 that suit go hard\cb1 \
\cb3 or hey sir i really like he like\cb1 \
\cb3 and because you're not seeing enough of\cb1 \
\cb3 it so it's like on one hand i like it\cb1 \
\cb3 but then\cb1 \
\cb3 if i like it man does that make me gay i\cb1 \
\cb3 look at\cb1 \
\cb3 the calculus a lot of young guys go\cb1 \
\cb3 through and i'm like man\cb1 \
\cb3 uh understand something it's cool to\cb1 \
\cb3 want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 a grown man so i pushed so hard about\cb1 \
\cb3 just dressing like a teenager in your\cb1 \
\cb3 30s and 40s\cb1 \
\cb3 damn give young men something to aspire\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 why do they need to do anything if they\cb1 \
\cb3 got it all figured out\cb1 \
\cb3 it's 16.\cb1 \
\cb3 um why is it good to get a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 obsessed with you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's better for her it's better for you\cb1 \
\cb3 but here's the problem um\cb1 \
\cb3 many of us tend to have\cb1 \
\cb3 we tend to let people understand their\cb1 \
\cb3 in their value or their importance\cb1 \
\cb3 when it's too late i've told you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 don't make don't make high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 wait\cb1 \
\cb3 don't make a special men wait if you\cb1 \
\cb3 have something that's good don't\cb1 \
\cb3 show it that it's good late i have a\cb1 \
\cb3 friend that's\cb1 \
\cb3 quitting her job quitting her job\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you've ever been in corporate\cb1 \
\cb3 america before\cb1 \
\cb3 this is how companies tend to work when\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a top performer\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're making them lots of money\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll take the benefit they'll take\cb1 \
\cb3 the rewards\cb1 \
\cb3 but and they'll work you like a dog\cb1 \
\cb3 but when you put in your notice\cb1 \
\cb3 to say you're leaving then\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll start trying to offer you more\cb1 \
\cb3 money promotions\cb1 \
\cb3 this and that that is\cb1 \
\cb3 horrible because\cb1 \
\cb3 they knew how important you were when\cb1 \
\cb3 you were making the monies they should\cb1 \
\cb3 have treated you better\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't you shouldn't have to wait\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies give you if a man is\cb1 \
\cb3 this man is special give him what he\cb1 \
\cb3 deserves up front\cb1 \
\cb3 because you don't want to get your value\cb1 \
\cb3 after he says i'm going to quit to go\cb1 \
\cb3 over here\cb1 \
\cb3 the notion is this i've said this before\cb1 \
\cb3 if it will be smart as a business owner\cb1 \
\cb3 to pay your employees 10 or 20\cb1 \
\cb3 more than the market you want your woman\cb1 \
\cb3 your woman's your first employee\cb1 \
\cb3 and when working for you she should be\cb1 \
\cb3 content that she's working her head\cb1 \
\cb3 should be like this\cb1 \
\cb3 my job is him him him him him him and\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 to where she's so busy she knows that\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a good deal\cb1 \
\cb3 a great deal she can focus on delivering\cb1 \
\cb3 value for him\cb1 \
\cb3 to where if she ever does have to look\cb1 \
\cb3 up and check to see\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what what's out on the market oh okay\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 they're paying this much for the job and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm making 10 20 more\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm making more than the market and i\cb1 \
\cb3 like the job\cb1 \
\cb3 but many guys we wanted this we want\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 and that leads to a better\cb1 \
\cb3 happier employee\cb1 \
\cb3 most of them this is the situation you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want she's completely invested\cb1 \
\cb3 and then she starts looking around and\cb1 \
\cb3 she realizes\cb1 \
\cb3 she's not getting anywhere close to what\cb1 \
\cb3 she should be getting\cb1 \
\cb3 then she started taking applications and\cb1 \
\cb3 interviews then\cb1 \
\cb3 she started acting a certain way then i\cb1 \
\cb3 said you want to pay her more\cb1 \
\cb3 no ladies same scenario\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to be done that way men\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to be done that right way\cb1 \
\cb3 either what's going on letitia immute\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 hi kevin hey\cb1 \
\cb3 welcome back to the lights and stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 right yay\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel like i'm calling in so much and i\cb1 \
\cb3 know it's probably irritating some\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 but i just had to call in because i am\cb1 \
\cb3 sitting here with my daughter\cb1 \
\cb3 and she had disagreed with something\cb1 \
\cb3 that you said\cb1 \
\cb3 and i correct her um\cb1 \
\cb3 he said that a woman has to love a man\cb1 \
\cb3 more than a man loves a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 most women automatically get upset\cb1 \
\cb3 um i think women don't understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 concept because they're\cb1 \
\cb3 they feel as if they're loving a man and\cb1 \
\cb3 that man doesn't return that love but i\cb1 \
\cb3 have to explain to her in the context of\cb1 \
\cb3 a relationship in the context of\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 um men stay men tend to stay when\cb1 \
\cb3 when when the rubber meets the road the\cb1 \
\cb3 tough gets going everything is\cb1 \
\cb3 difficult men tend to stay um\cb1 \
\cb3 whereas women are more inclined to leave\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's why you see such tighter\cb1 \
\cb3 the worst rates with women being the\cb1 \
\cb3 majority fowlers\cb1 \
\cb3 um if if you meet a woman who loves you\cb1 \
\cb3 more than a man she's more\cb1 \
\cb3 likely she's more inclined to fight for\cb1 \
\cb3 that marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 she's more likely going to stay inside\cb1 \
\cb3 why do you think most women don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 will balk against what i said that a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that a man that a woman needs to love a\cb1 \
\cb3 man more than he loves her why do you\cb1 \
\cb3 think most women push back against it\cb1 \
\cb3 because we're raised to um\cb1 \
\cb3 focus on ourselves yeah we're meant to\cb1 \
\cb3 give give give and we're just\cb1 \
\cb3 to receive seed seed\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah we're we we were raised to um\cb1 \
\cb3 i had to kind of step back wait a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i see we didn't have i didn't have\cb1 \
\cb3 this conversation with my daughter i\cb1 \
\cb3 guess i'm giving my old my age because\cb1 \
\cb3 she's she's\cb1 \
\cb3 an adult right um\cb1 \
\cb3 i was like wow okay i need to when this\cb1 \
\cb3 ends i have to have a conversation with\cb1 \
\cb3 her to ensure that she\cb1 \
\cb3 knows and understands the dynamics\cb1 \
\cb3 between men and women i thought i\cb1 \
\cb3 did but just hearing her make that\cb1 \
\cb3 statement i was like okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but the question is always it always\cb1 \
\cb3 ends in fear\cb1 \
\cb3 yes if i love him more than he loves me\cb1 \
\cb3 then bad outcomes if he leaves then i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 messed up\cb1 \
\cb3 if this happened then i messed up if\cb1 \
\cb3 this happened that i messed up and like\cb1 \
\cb3 well why\cb1 \
\cb3 then you need to make sure he doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 leave correct\cb1 \
\cb3 then you need to make sure that doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 happen yes and see that puts a\cb1 \
\cb3 responsibility on women as well to step\cb1 \
\cb3 back and earn\cb1 \
\cb3 their position that is true\cb1 \
\cb3 i will say i was obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 i was obsessed with the two two men ever\cb1 \
\cb3 in my life\cb1 \
\cb3 and how i knew i was obsessed with them\cb1 \
\cb3 um was that they would never hear me\cb1 \
\cb3 tell them no\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 i was willing to drink those mint the\cb1 \
\cb3 bath water you know as men will say\cb1 \
\cb3 man i'll drink her bath water they had\cb1 \
\cb3 me so\cb1 \
\cb3 addicted to them i am a sapiosexual so\cb1 \
\cb3 they had me so addicted to them\cb1 \
\cb3 that it was like i didn't want to say no\cb1 \
\cb3 i did not desire to say no\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever they did whatever they needed\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever need needed to be met i was\cb1 \
\cb3 going to say yes\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how a woman can tell that she's\cb1 \
\cb3 addicted or obsessed\cb1 \
\cb3 with a man is she's more inclined to\cb1 \
\cb3 tell him yes\cb1 \
\cb3 yep that's what i tell a lot of women on\cb1 \
\cb3 the show just say yes say yes yes yes\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm in the chat room looking at some\cb1 \
\cb3 of the black women just throw up these\cb1 \
\cb3 emoji faces and internet\cb1 \
\cb3 and all you are single all you are\cb1 \
\cb3 single and unmarried but yet you're so\cb1 \
\cb3 bored all you can imagine is a world\cb1 \
\cb3 where you don't lose\cb1 \
\cb3 fear so i laugh at you ladies in the\cb1 \
\cb3 chat room making all these faces because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're\cb1 \
\cb3 single as french toast and that strong\cb1 \
\cb3 independent\cb1 \
\cb3 board [ __ ] is keeping you single and by\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself but as usual\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what your marriage prospects look\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 and you got the nerve to sit around and\cb1 \
\cb3 be bored but yet you're here\cb1 \
\cb3 you're here because this is where the\cb1 \
\cb3 action is this is where the men are and\cb1 \
\cb3 this is where the women who are trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to get their [ __ ] together\cb1 \
\cb3 and come on to some court of accord with\cb1 \
\cb3 a man to get a better outcome\cb1 \
\cb3 than your bored ass is go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 okay oh wow um so\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm being courted right now by a\cb1 \
\cb3 gentleman and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm at the point where it's it's always\cb1 \
\cb3 a yes\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a it's a yes with him um\cb1 \
\cb3 so and he he he's\cb1 \
\cb3 he he's and he's reciprocating\cb1 \
\cb3 so he's it's relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 dynamics marriage is reciprocal and i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't understand why people\cb1 \
\cb3 um don't grasp that well they don't they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't grasp it because it's always about\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a selfish\cb1 \
\cb3 fear-based response it's me me me me me\cb1 \
\cb3 and then these are the same women who'll\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about\cb1 \
\cb3 my kids instead of our kids\cb1 \
\cb3 and i understand it but i don't condone\cb1 \
\cb3 it because\cb1 \
\cb3 if you if it ain't working for you see\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't come over here\cb1 \
\cb3 and act like what you you're too too\cb1 \
\cb3 cool for school\cb1 \
\cb3 and you don't have the outcomes to show\cb1 \
\cb3 it and that is so many black women are\cb1 \
\cb3 proud to be losers\cb1 \
\cb3 proud failures i'm like you're proud to\cb1 \
\cb3 fail\cb1 \
\cb3 you know one out of four of you will\cb1 \
\cb3 marry 80 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 are overweight and you're failing at\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 and you act like you know every goddamn\cb1 \
\cb3 thing you queen\cb1 \
\cb3 you boss you diva you level up loser\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm here to tell you the men that\cb1 \
\cb3 you want the kind of men you want\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want you because you're a proud\cb1 \
\cb3 loser\cb1 \
\cb3 a dog\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm gonna go but i just want to say\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies just learn to say yes\cb1 \
\cb3 and whatever you like it's not that hard\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever you like get get used to if you\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta stand in the mirror and repeat it\cb1 \
\cb3 back to yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 until you finally believe it start\cb1 \
\cb3 saying yes\cb1 \
\cb3 more than you say no and whatever you\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 that is it's not a bad thing and it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not difficult and stop listening to\cb1 \
\cb3 people telling you\cb1 \
\cb3 well if you give a man everything he's\cb1 \
\cb3 going to hurt you right that's something\cb1 \
\cb3 that happens but unless this man is\cb1 \
\cb3 giving you\cb1 \
\cb3 cues if he's giving you cues that he's\cb1 \
\cb3 going to hurt you and you're seeing the\cb1 \
\cb3 red flags and you end up and you do\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing about it and you end up getting\cb1 \
\cb3 hurt\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to take accountability and\cb1 \
\cb3 responsibility at the fact that right\cb1 \
\cb3 you did nothing to\cb1 \
\cb3 get yourself out of situation and you\cb1 \
\cb3 continue forward in a bad situation\cb1 \
\cb3 but you also have to remember that's not\cb1 \
\cb3 every man of course not\cb1 \
\cb3 it's out here are decent\cb1 \
\cb3 good wanting men who want to be loved\cb1 \
\cb3 correctly\cb1 \
\cb3 but unfortunately the young women have\cb1 \
\cb3 been taught\cb1 \
\cb3 incorrectly how to love them thanks sis\cb1 \
\cb3 okay good night see i think it's and\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for people in the in the\cb1 \
\cb3 comments section\cb1 \
\cb3 well you're saying these are not\cb1 \
\cb3 counters people\cb1 \
\cb3 these are not counters so\cb1 \
\cb3 proud losers\cb1 \

\cb3 cold and flu season\cb1 \
\cb3 and a full-on coronavirus cold and flu\cb1 \
\cb3 season\cb1 \
\cb3 so asking what i am or am not doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 change what you\cb1 \

\cb3 much attention\cb1 \
\cb3 guys yeah okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you know so i feel like if you give a\cb1 \
\cb3 guy too much attention then\cb1 \
\cb3 they would become um disinterested\cb1 \
\cb3 well all right now you're a little bit\cb1 \
\cb3 young for my channel\cb1 \
\cb3 um teenage dating in high school\cb1 \
\cb3 what age of the guys we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all\cb1 \
\cb3 um well i don't talk to any but um from\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've noticed\cb1 \
\cb3 um at my school that's just what it\cb1 \
\cb3 seems like\cb1 \

\cb3 you you folks will never know what's\cb1 \
\cb3 going on in my personal life\cb1 \
\cb3 because what i've seen over the last\cb1 \
\cb3 four months\cb1 \
\cb3 no thank you i'm a public person i will\cb1 \
\cb3 not subject my personal life to this\cb1 \
\cb3 the better question is what's happening\cb1 \
\cb3 in your world because you're here\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're a woman and you're here why\cb1 \
\cb3 are you here\cb1 \
\cb3 and i will say i find it interesting\cb1 \
\cb3 that some of the the people who are some\cb1 \
\cb3 of my most art and critics\cb1 \
\cb3 but you you sure watch my content a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 if i don't know what i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you watching my content and i've\cb1 \
\cb3 heard some women say well i like to make\cb1 \
\cb3 a response\cb1 \
\cb3 to what he's saying because i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 he's doing damage first off\cb1 \
\cb3 if you make a response to me and use my\cb1 \
\cb3 content don't be surprised if you have\cb1 \
\cb3 if we don't vibe don't use my content i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't play those games\cb1 \
\cb3 if we don't vibe to take my stuff out of\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 video and you stand over there by\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself because\cb1 \
\cb3 uh i will call them folks on you i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 play games like that\cb1 \
\cb3 i will talk to you if you want to come\cb1 \
\cb3 over here and talk to me but don't\cb1 \
\cb3 talk to me on your channel because you\cb1 \
\cb3 are misrepresenting myself number one\cb1 \
\cb3 number two\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't even like black men why are\cb1 \
\cb3 you over here\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 what bothers a lot of women a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 sisters in particular is what just\cb1 \
\cb3 happened young black women are listening\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 me and these spaces and they're getting\cb1 \
\cb3 information\cb1 \
\cb3 that's going to be actionable as going\cb1 \
\cb3 to help them because\cb1 \
\cb3 they're men over here if you're in a\cb1 \
\cb3 space\cb1 \
\cb3 where it's dominated by women telling\cb1 \
\cb3 women what men want\cb1 \
\cb3 you're in a bad space let me explain\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're in a space where the majority\cb1 \
\cb3 of the\cb1 \
\cb3 the audience is women telling women what\cb1 \
\cb3 men want\cb1 \
\cb3 and a man ain't there the end consumer\cb1 \
\cb3 of a product that is a woman is a man\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies don't know what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you're listening to a bunch of\cb1 \
\cb3 women older women\cb1 \
\cb3 women who cannot go out and show you\cb1 \
\cb3 that they can do the things that they\cb1 \
\cb3 say\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can do if you do these things\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 all right\cb1 \
\cb3 um here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 do high value men love to chase hold on\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on let me let me go back to this\cb1 \
\cb3 question and put it on the screen\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and i really uh seriously don't\cb1 \
\cb3 don't play my content on your channel\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies if you don't come over here and\cb1 \

\cb3 you're treating him like every other guy\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want a man that's special\cb1 \
\cb3 treat him special and what we're finding\cb1 \
\cb3 is so many of you ladies don't know how\cb1 \
\cb3 to treat a man special\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't you want something better than\cb1 \
\cb3 you're willing to do\cb1 \
\cb3 like i said many women don't want to\cb1 \

\cb3 yet you're proud losers strong\cb1 \
\cb3 independent i don't need no man i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 phd\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm all this other stuff but yet that\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't really what you want\cb1 \

\cb3 what okay would you like to marry oh i\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 tracy ellis ross i would love to be\cb1 \
\cb3 married i wouldn't turn down a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship with a high value man but i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want him to actually think i need\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 i've got a succulent beautiful delicious\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship with my\cb1 \
\cb3 solitude what\cb1 \
\cb3 well that sounds better than i really\cb1 \
\cb3 would like a man except i just don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have the relationship skills let's talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about it\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 are perfectly fine on paper but you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have the relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 skills necessary to keep a man\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is something you need to\cb1 \
\cb3 address\cb1 \
\cb3 you can get him interested you can have\cb1 \
\cb3 sex one two three times\cb1 \
\cb3 but you cannot keep him interested in\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to be there\cb1 \
\cb3 what kind of work do you think you need\cb1 \
\cb3 to do\cb1 \
\cb3 and many of you don't feel like you have\cb1 \
\cb3 to do anything other than show up\cb1 \
\cb3 all right\cb1 \
\cb3 guys don't care i have a sexy degree so\cb1 \
\cb3 here's what i'm gonna do\cb1 \
\cb3 for the next 20 minutes i'm going to\cb1 \
\cb3 open it up for anybody to call in\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have a disagreement you can\cb1 \
\cb3 welcome to call in too\cb1 \
\cb3 britney davis why are you here let me go\cb1 \
\cb3 ahead just block you\cb1 \
\cb3 you come to my chat room every day to\cb1 \
\cb3 talk [ __ ] why are you here\cb1 \
\cb3 let's all go ahead and tap you out so\cb1 \
\cb3 let's go ahead and give brittany her\cb1 \
\cb3 final\cb1 \
\cb3 goodbye this is all she comes to do is\cb1 \
\cb3 talk [ __ ] so let's go ahead and give\cb1 \
\cb3 britney her final goodbye\cb1 \
\cb3 um because she can never say anything\cb1 \
\cb3 positive\cb1 \
\cb3 and she only just comes over here to say\cb1 \
\cb3 this so britney\cb1 \
\cb3 seek therapy seek help sis\cb1 \
\cb3 you know we're hands down one of the\cb1 \
\cb3 most negative women\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most confrontational women\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most difficult women\cb1 \
\cb3 and i get it you don't know how to deal\cb1 \
\cb3 with guys in real life\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're proving it every time you\cb1 \
\cb3 come over here and statements like this\cb1 \
\cb3 are dumb\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman is the final this is the final\cb1 \
\cb3 decision maker on who makes a baby\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't have any respect i don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 any sympathy for baby mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 they chose a woman chooses to be a baby\cb1 \
\cb3 mama\cb1 \
\cb3 mary before you carry 30 some odd forms\cb1 \
\cb3 of birth control\cb1 \
\cb3 and women like brittany women that you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies honestly should look at as your\cb1 \
\cb3 enemy\cb1 \
\cb3 why because thinking like that keeps you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies completely unaccountable\cb1 \
\cb3 to any of the choices you make and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not how the world works\cb1 \
\cb3 things happen granted understood being a\cb1 \
\cb3 baby mama is not a death sentence but it\cb1 \
\cb3 certainly\cb1 \
\cb3 does greatly impact your value on the\cb1 \
\cb3 open dating market\cb1 \
\cb3 um so brittany\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta go bye-bye\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you haven't learned anything in three\cb1 \
\cb3 weeks a month\cb1 \
\cb3 you're just here you don't need to be\cb1 \
\cb3 here now you can watch\cb1 \
\cb3 but you can't talk\cb1 \
\cb3 now if i block you\cb1 \
\cb3 the only way to get off the block list\cb1 \
\cb3 is to write me\cb1 \
\cb3 an email and explain to me\cb1 \
\cb3 why you are blocked and why i should\cb1 \
\cb3 unblock you\cb1 \
\cb3 because make no mistake she's been here\cb1 \
\cb3 for over a month and from what i've seen\cb1 \
\cb3 she hasn't gotten any better\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't expect women to come over here\cb1 \
\cb3 and automatically agree with us\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact i expect women to come\cb1 \
\cb3 over here and\cb1 \
\cb3 vehemently disagree most of the time\cb1 \
\cb3 because the stuff we talk about over\cb1 \
\cb3 here\cb1 \
\cb3 is jarring um\cb1 \
\cb3 it's arguably somewhat\cb1 \
\cb3 new uh and\cb1 \
\cb3 if it's not really being talked about\cb1 \
\cb3 there may be like\cb1 \
\cb3 lack of context and guys we got to be\cb1 \
\cb3 willing to keep\cb1 \
\cb3 they're going to be new people coming\cb1 \
\cb3 over you got to be willing to explain it\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you talk about something in a\cb1 \
\cb3 logical way\cb1 \
\cb3 for a certain length of time and it\cb1 \
\cb3 still doesn't seem to connect\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not really coming in good faith\cb1 \
\cb3 fear i understand you we want to take\cb1 \
\cb3 the\cb1 \
\cb3 the risk out of relationships you cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot take the risk out of\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships but like them\cb1 \
\cb3 like latisha said ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to be love a man more\cb1 \
\cb3 than he loves you\cb1 \
\cb3 well he needs to love his purpose\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you're a christian he's supposed\cb1 \
\cb3 to love god more than he loves you right\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies why don't you want to have\cb1 \
\cb3 why do you want all the risk to be\cb1 \
\cb3 everywhere else\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have none\cb1 \
\cb3 that's selfish\cb1 \
\cb3 and it simply does not work long term\cb1 \
\cb3 so at the end of the day\cb1 \
\cb3 obsession is a good thing obsession for\cb1 \
\cb3 your man is a good\cb1 \
\cb3 thing you need to be obsessed with\cb1 \
\cb3 something why\cb1 \
\cb3 is it you're the ability what comes with\cb1 \
\cb3 obsession\cb1 \
\cb3 focus focus\cb1 \
\cb3 it's hard to be obsessed on something if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not focused on it\cb1 \
\cb3 focus top of mind what consumes your\cb1 \
\cb3 thoughts controls your life\cb1 \
\cb3 and think well i don't want a man to\cb1 \
\cb3 control my life\cb1 \
\cb3 no you don't want the wrong man to\cb1 \
\cb3 control your life again\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it that you want ladies do you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to be a career woman\cb1 \
\cb3 or do you want to be a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 i want a career in a relationship well\cb1 \
\cb3 you spend more time in your career than\cb1 \
\cb3 your relationship your relationship's\cb1 \
\cb3 going to suffer\cb1 \
\cb3 if you work it eight-hour days that's 40\cb1 \
\cb3 days a week you sleep in eight hours\cb1 \
\cb3 that means sleeping eight hours working\cb1 \
\cb3 eight hours\cb1 \
\cb3 commute 30 minutes\cb1 \
\cb3 most of the day is gone between sleep\cb1 \
\cb3 and work you have\cb1 \
\cb3 precious little time to sit back and\cb1 \
\cb3 relate\cb1 \
\cb3 first if you slept eight hours then you\cb1 \
\cb3 weren't working 40\cb1 \
\cb3 if you worked 20 if you worked on your\cb1 \
\cb3 man's business\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever you have more time to build a\cb1 \
\cb3 firm foundation\cb1 \
\cb3 that is built on more than just weekend\cb1 \
\cb3 sex this is why i talked about um\cb1 \
\cb3 professional women in long-distance\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 we need to learn how to relate to people\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's the issue\cb1 \
\cb3 the the issue is not so much in meeting\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 getting the issue is that whole getting\cb1 \
\cb3 to know you phase that people\cb1 \
\cb3 really don't like to do people really\cb1 \
\cb3 don't like to get to know your face they\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get to the relationship for it\cb1 \
\cb3 but what you really want to do is get\cb1 \
\cb3 into the keeping part the life part\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have a problem meeting people\cb1 \
\cb3 that's one thing you have a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 getting uh getting commitment\cb1 \
\cb3 a one-to-one relationship that's another\cb1 \
\cb3 thing but they have a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 getting long-term where are you at\cb1 \
\cb3 where's the difficulty where's the\cb1 \
\cb3 disconnect\cb1 \
\cb3 because men are pretty much simple\cb1 \
\cb3 we are cost benefit calculators and if a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 is on a man's side and he understands\cb1 \
\cb3 that she is down for him\cb1 \
\cb3 why would he not commit why would he not\cb1 \
\cb3 say okay i'll take you\cb1 \
\cb3 and you ladies eventually going to\cb1 \
\cb3 decide\cb1 \
\cb3 pick\cb1 \
\cb3 says you ever slept with a girl a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 in months and she still said\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah um you don't necessarily get the\cb1 \
\cb3 the most potent form yes\cb1 \
\cb3 keeping a woman sexually obsessed is one\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 but keeping her mentally women\cb1 \
\cb3 in general despise boredom\cb1 \
\cb3 despise boredom\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you're a boring guy you know i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't mean that you\cb1 \
\cb3 well you just have to understand how\cb1 \
\cb3 your particular woman moves\cb1 \
\cb3 and keep give her something to be\cb1 \
\cb3 accurate give her a reason\cb1 \
\cb3 all right guys back in atlanta\cb1 \

\cb3 career\cb1 \
\cb3 in corporate america i spent 20 years in\cb1 \
\cb3 corporate business to business sales\cb1 \
\cb3 and telecommunications until that\cb1 \
\cb3 industry fell apart\cb1 \
\cb3 i.e worldcom all the telecommunications\cb1 \
\cb3 blah blah blah blah blah\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's a little bit in office products\cb1 \
\cb3 and then in advertising\cb1 \
\cb3 why is all that important well because\cb1 \
\cb3 i've in these streets is where i made my\cb1 \
\cb3 bones here in manhattan\cb1 \
\cb3 a little guy from oklahoma via dallas\cb1 \
\cb3 came up here and kicked people's ass\cb1 \
\cb3 why does that mean why does that matter\cb1 \
\cb3 because i think it matters\cb1 \
\cb3 when you know who you're talking to and\cb1 \
\cb3 i will tell you that when i came to new\cb1 \
\cb3 york city is when i first\cb1 \
\cb3 saw real success i mean i saw success\cb1 \
\cb3 you know in dallas and houston don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 me wrong but when i came to\cb1 \
\cb3 manhattan is when i saw that a million\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars was just getting started\cb1 \
\cb3 you know when oklahoma when you know\cb1 \
\cb3 back then if you was making 50 000 you\cb1 \
\cb3 were rich\cb1 \
\cb3 here that was a paycheck\cb1 \
\cb3 for some people why is that important\cb1 \
\cb3 because tonight's subject is going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 appointed discussion\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get right into it let's get right\cb1 \
\cb3 into it should high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men marry out should high value or\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 and ladies i'm gonna throw you in there\cb1 \
\cb3 too but why am i talking to the high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men tonight because i need you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies to understand these are the men\cb1 \
\cb3 you want\cb1 \
\cb3 see we can talk about the dusty's the\cb1 \
\cb3 crusties the beta male coons and all\cb1 \
\cb3 that other\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the men you want and my\cb1 \
\cb3 question is this\cb1 \
\cb3 should they should they marry out now\cb1 \
\cb3 funny i've heard this being kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 discussed a little bit on other\cb1 \
\cb3 platforms\cb1 \
\cb3 to a lesser degree talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody and most of what i've heard is\cb1 \
\cb3 even in the chat room is that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 saw it coming up\cb1 \
\cb3 people were more or less saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 you should not even if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high value\cb1 \
\cb3 you should still wait\cb1 \
\cb3 and marry within your group or the race\cb1 \
\cb3 and my question is this\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have done what it takes to be\cb1 \
\cb3 make yourself high value\cb1 \
\cb3 or if you are competitive and let's\cb1 \
\cb3 define competitive i consider a\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive man\cb1 \
\cb3 in the top 20 percent of men\cb1 \
\cb3 the top 20 percent of men that puts it\cb1 \
\cb3 around 70 000\cb1 \
\cb3 a year i consider that to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 financially competitive man\cb1 \
\cb3 top 20 to the top 15 20 that's 70 to 85\cb1 \
\cb3 000\cb1 \
\cb3 anything above that puts you in the in\cb1 \
\cb3 striking range of high value\cb1 \
\cb3 i consider you to be financially\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive if you're making seventy\cb1 \
\cb3 thousand dollars or more living in\cb1 \
\cb3 dallas houston austin san antonio\cb1 \
\cb3 where the cost of living buys a dollar\cb1 \
\cb3 will buy a dollar\cb1 \
\cb3 in new york city you need to adjust that\cb1 \
\cb3 up to about 150.\cb1 \
\cb3 in the bay area likewise so if you're a\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 who's financially attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a career of which you can\cb1 \
\cb3 explain\cb1 \
\cb3 in less than 20 seconds district manager\cb1 \
\cb3 for verizon or whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 or you own your own plumbing business\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever you have\cb1 \
\cb3 an income that's consistent\cb1 \
\cb3 you are in reasonable shape\cb1 \
\cb3 i consider you agree competitive and\cb1 \
\cb3 you're heterosexual i consider to be\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive anything on top of that is\cb1 \
\cb3 just a perk\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care how tall you are\cb1 \
\cb3 men like this tend to have been married\cb1 \
\cb3 the older they get or have children the\cb1 \
\cb3 older they get\cb1 \
\cb3 but we're talking about men across the\cb1 \
\cb3 board\cb1 \
\cb3 my hit squad guys my guys from 18 to 30\cb1 \
\cb3 can also fit into this group\cb1 \
\cb3 high earners in training or henry's in\cb1 \
\cb3 training high earners not rich yet in\cb1 \
\cb3 training hit squad\cb1 \
\cb3 henry's all these guys are henry's\cb1 \
\cb3 high or higher earners high earners not\cb1 \
\cb3 rich yet just a second\cb1 \
\cb3 why why is this important is that music\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to see if that music is loud\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it stopped\cb1 \
\cb3 oh why is all this important because\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get to the bottom of it ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the men that you want\cb1 \
\cb3 and a man does not have to be fine\cb1 \
\cb3 that's your job\cb1 \
\cb3 a man just has to be in shape fit for\cb1 \
\cb3 life an athlete for work\cb1 \
\cb3 and the question is a man that's\cb1 \
\cb3 actually done these things\cb1 \
\cb3 who's got himself an education a trade\cb1 \
\cb3 or a profession\cb1 \
\cb3 is earning more you know it's earning\cb1 \
\cb3 more than most people\cb1 \
\cb3 it's earning twice what a middle class\cb1 \
\cb3 family makes in this country the middle\cb1 \
\cb3 class family in this country makes\cb1 \
\cb3 around eighty\cb1 \
\cb3 two forty two thousand dollars a year so\cb1 \
\cb3 if a man is making\cb1 \
\cb3 twice what a middle class family makes\cb1 \
\cb3 i would consider him to be successful\cb1 \
\cb3 and successful makes you competitive and\cb1 \
\cb3 for the longest we've talked about\cb1 \
\cb3 the lack of competitive men the lack of\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive men that's why this whole\cb1 \
\cb3 high value thing came along and people\cb1 \
\cb3 just kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 thumb their nose at it because they talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about that they're no competitive me and\cb1 \
\cb3 much less high value\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 well that's the stats are in\cb1 \
\cb3 the facts are in the statistics are in\cb1 \
\cb3 and there are\cb1 \
\cb3 there are competitive men out here and\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men out here the question is\cb1 \
\cb3 if these men exist which they do\cb1 \
\cb3 should they marry out well the question\cb1 \
\cb3 is well why should they marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin glad you asked well\cb1 \
\cb3 one in four black women will marry in\cb1 \
\cb3 their lifetime and what i realized and\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've learned\cb1 \
\cb3 over months and months and months of\cb1 \
\cb3 talking to men\cb1 \
\cb3 and women that women have often ran\cb1 \
\cb3 across\cb1 \
\cb3 men in their in their youth\cb1 \
\cb3 that they have just bypassed waiting\cb1 \
\cb3 opting to stay on the train opting to\cb1 \
\cb3 enjoy their 20s not worried about\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get right into it this is about\cb1 \
\cb3 black folk\cb1 \
\cb3 and if a black man is competitive and\cb1 \
\cb3 successful\cb1 \
\cb3 on his way to becoming high value\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely henry\cb1 \
\cb3 why should he wait\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking you ladies why should he wait\cb1 \
\cb3 for women\cb1 \
\cb3 from 18 to 27 who never\cb1 \
\cb3 really interested in marriage until you\cb1 \
\cb3 know later on in life\cb1 \
\cb3 when do a lot of women start getting\cb1 \
\cb3 interested in marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 when do a lot of women start getting\cb1 \
\cb3 interested in marriage guys\cb1 \
\cb3 do a lot of women start getting\cb1 \
\cb3 interested in marriage\cb1 \

\cb3 marriage when they get that danger zone\cb1 \

\cb3 to think of getting married and building\cb1 \
\cb3 with somebody in their youth\cb1 \

\cb3 you know i've had people brothers in the\cb1 \
\cb3 comment section are we starting to see\cb1 \
\cb3 women open their eyes\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just one man you know and i will say\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel sorry for many women who\cb1 \
\cb3 many of our sisters who were lied to\cb1 \
\cb3 led astray but the fact of the matter is\cb1 \
\cb3 i see young men\cb1 \
\cb3 who are doing the work\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to continue to move forward life\cb1 \
\cb3 and i cannot in good conscience\cb1 \
\cb3 tell them that they need to spend the\cb1 \
\cb3 next 10 or 15 years\cb1 \
\cb3 just waiting well wait a minute kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 wait a minute kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 you're telling these guys that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should date out i'm saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking you what would you tell them\cb1 \
\cb3 here's one of the common objections well\cb1 \
\cb3 wait wait a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys normally say well they've\cb1 \
\cb3 dated this girl that they dated kim and\cb1 \
\cb3 keisha and tammy\cb1 \
\cb3 and tanisha and shannon and karen\cb1 \
\cb3 and and zoey and\cb1 \
\cb3 and amber well they but they haven't\cb1 \
\cb3 dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all black women that is one of the how\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the number one reason you've\cb1 \
\cb3 dated some black women but you haven't\cb1 \
\cb3 dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all black women brothers men how many\cb1 \
\cb3 times have you heard this\cb1 \
\cb3 you've dated some but you haven't dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all if you've heard this as a man\cb1 \
\cb3 raise your hand put a one in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room you've dated some black women but\cb1 \
\cb3 you haven't dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all put in one in the chat room if you\cb1 \
\cb3 heard that\cb1 \
\cb3 the sum not all i mean you've only dated\cb1 \
\cb3 some\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 brown becky whoo the lies uh look here\cb1 \
\cb3 chick\cb1 \
\cb3 you you need to know where you are\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to know where you are you call\cb1 \
\cb3 in my show if you like to\cb1 \
\cb3 but don't come over here talking crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't lie over here\cb1 \
\cb3 look at all these men saying they've\cb1 \
\cb3 heard this you've dated some but you\cb1 \
\cb3 haven't dated all\cb1 \
\cb3 and the thing is my question is this to\cb1 \
\cb3 the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 so black women who tell these guys to\cb1 \
\cb3 stand in racial solidarity\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i'm not taking the position i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 asking the questions\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking the women what should the men\cb1 \
\cb3 do what would you tell your son to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your blood brother\cb1 \
\cb3 to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell him to do you tell\cb1 \
\cb3 him to just stand there\cb1 \
\cb3 and and and you know to a competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful or high value man the most\cb1 \
\cb3 important asset is time\cb1 \
\cb3 the most important resource is time\cb1 \
\cb3 wasting time\cb1 \
\cb3 wasting time well you got to put in time\cb1 \
\cb3 and effort\cb1 \
\cb3 well marisol marlene becky and i knew\cb1 \
\cb3 are coming after him\cb1 \
\cb3 after uh keith and after marcus\cb1 \
\cb3 and after reggie i mean and after aaron\cb1 \
\cb3 and after greg\cb1 \
\cb3 these women aren't wasting time matter\cb1 \
\cb3 of fact dr t\cb1 \
\cb3 san johnson talks about how these women\cb1 \
\cb3 are enrolled in his class\cb1 \
\cb3 right now in college to learn how to be\cb1 \
\cb3 better girlfriends and wives for black\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 these women aren't are approaching\cb1 \
\cb3 they are actively competing for men\cb1 \
\cb3 so you want you telling your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 your son that he should take his active\cb1 \
\cb3 time\cb1 \
\cb3 to pursue a passive possible partner\cb1 \
\cb3 let me say that again you're telling\cb1 \
\cb3 your brother your loved blood brother\cb1 \
\cb3 or your biological son that he should\cb1 \
\cb3 take his time to pursue\cb1 \
\cb3 actively pursue a passive\cb1 \
\cb3 possible partner you want him to\cb1 \
\cb3 actively pursue somebody who's passive\cb1 \
\cb3 well he has to actively pursue these but\cb1 \
\cb3 these women are actively pursuing him\cb1 \
\cb3 how that's supposed to work okay\cb1 \
\cb3 scratch that he's out here already\cb1 \
\cb3 dating\cb1 \
\cb3 and he can't find we're all the good\cb1 \
\cb3 ones we're all the good women here\cb1 \
\cb3 where are they i've said it myself if\cb1 \
\cb3 you are a competitive or a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 woman it's\cb1 \
\cb3 only a fool hides value if you're out\cb1 \
\cb3 there why can't he find you\cb1 \
\cb3 because becky marisol mailing and i knew\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't having any problems\cb1 \
\cb3 finding one in three black men who have\cb1 \
\cb3 a college degree\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out they're not having a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 finding black men\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you if you consider yourself to\cb1 \
\cb3 be a competitive or a higher value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 having a problem finding them\cb1 \
\cb3 is it because you're sitting there\cb1 \
\cb3 waiting for god to do it\cb1 \
\cb3 you wait no jesus what is it\cb1 \
\cb3 or heather's learning fried chicken\cb1 \
\cb3 well you ain't dead at all black women\cb1 \
\cb3 so what is he supposed to do\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i get it he's supposed to move i get\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the men that are supposed to go\cb1 \
\cb3 be successful in his area then he's\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to move wherever he is\cb1 \
\cb3 and then go be go move where the women\cb1 \
\cb3 are and then\cb1 \
\cb3 go hunt the women\cb1 \
\cb3 well if he's doing all that\cb1 \
\cb3 what about the business\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is what you ladies need to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive men you must compete for\cb1 \
\cb3 these\cb1 \
\cb3 you must compete for these men you must\cb1 \
\cb3 compete with the women that are around\cb1 \
\cb3 him and women\cb1 \
\cb3 are drawn to power money and status\cb1 \
\cb3 if the man you want has power money and\cb1 \
\cb3 status\cb1 \
\cb3 you best believe there's going to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 group of women around him how\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive are you with those women\cb1 \
\cb3 and expecting him to pick solely on\cb1 \
\cb3 racial solidarity\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i think it's a pretty uh\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think that's a power position\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm willing to hear the argument\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your brother to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your son to do well\cb1 \
\cb3 he ain't ate all the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 okay my question is also is this how\cb1 \
\cb3 many\cb1 \
\cb3 how many women should he date before he\cb1 \
\cb3 does that how many black women should a\cb1 \
\cb3 black man date\cb1 \
\cb3 before he starts dating white women i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 just going to go there tonight i'm going\cb1 \
\cb3 there\cb1 \
\cb3 forget marisol marlene and i knew let's\cb1 \
\cb3 just go there\cb1 \
\cb3 how many black women should a black man\cb1 \
\cb3 date before he starts dating white women\cb1 \

\cb3 get him up get him up\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your brother what\cb1 \
\cb3 would you tell him\cb1 \
\cb3 bro i love you i want to see you happy\cb1 \
\cb3 the women out here that are quote\cb1 \
\cb3 unquote on your level\cb1 \
\cb3 they're they they are not trying to even\cb1 \
\cb3 stay in shape for themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 they ain't even trying to stay fit for\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves i know you can't take her to\cb1 \
\cb3 the home builders association ball i\cb1 \
\cb3 know you can't take her to the you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 take her anywhere\cb1 \
\cb3 she got you know she can't wear\cb1 \
\cb3 something with her back out with all\cb1 \
\cb3 them rolls and carrying on\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean really what would you tell these\cb1 \
\cb3 men because these are the\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful men these are the\cb1 \
\cb3 guys on the way to being those high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 yet you should just pick a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 unfit not physically fit\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't even prize her appearance\cb1 \
\cb3 when you have fit women checking for you\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not purple it's blue\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling the guys that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should do\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling the guys they\cb1 \
\cb3 should do are you saying that look here\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 i i don't i know what i want i know\cb1 \
\cb3 that i raised you to love this\cb1 \
\cb3 man if you type in all caps if you keep\cb1 \
\cb3 typing in all caps you're going to get\cb1 \
\cb3 uh timed out\cb1 \
\cb3 uh victoria whitlock i already timed you\cb1 \
\cb3 out earlier today\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to slow your roll\cb1 \
\cb3 let me go ahead and help you cause i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not gonna i'm not gonna have you expand\cb1 \
\cb3 my chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 you've been on one for the last two\cb1 \
\cb3 hours you came over here two hours early\cb1 \
\cb3 to start typing to nobody\cb1 \
\cb3 not gonna happen the things we do for\cb1 \
\cb3 love what's your husband say stacey\cb1 \
\cb3 baldwin\cb1 \
\cb3 because uh if anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know my position is i think\cb1 \
\cb3 brothers love sisters more than sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 love brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 i think if black women could date out\cb1 \
\cb3 like black men can\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd be gone but the reality is most of\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 this is my personal opinion i personally\cb1 \
\cb3 think\cb1 \
\cb3 that if black women in mass have the\cb1 \
\cb3 same\cb1 \
\cb3 level of market attractiveness\cb1 \
\cb3 to to non-black people\cb1 \
\cb3 as black men have to non-black people\cb1 \
\cb3 if you had the options that the rank and\cb1 \
\cb3 fire brother had you would take them\cb1 \
\cb3 i think a lot of you feel like you stuck\cb1 \
\cb3 with black men because you can't get\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing else\cb1 \
\cb3 because look at how you show up for them\cb1 \
\cb3 i say\cb1 \
\cb3 women should i say women tell men what\cb1 \
\cb3 they think they deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 by their appearance and their attitude\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 if the average black woman today\cb1 \
\cb3 eighty percent of you are overweight\cb1 \
\cb3 you're telling\cb1 \
\cb3 black men you don't think they deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 much\cb1 \
\cb3 if black men have been saying they want\cb1 \
\cb3 just cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have woman after woman after\cb1 \
\cb3 woman saying yeah i know that\cb1 \
\cb3 but they're not getting it black men\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't getting it you're saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperation and deserve a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't care about her appearance\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that won't fly with anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 else\cb1 \
\cb3 and then when you say something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 what do so many black women say\cb1 \
\cb3 well somebody will have to somebody love\cb1 \
\cb3 her somebody will hit it\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody that's always to come back when\cb1 \
\cb3 you start saying something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 when you start saying something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody will hit it somebody will hit\cb1 \
\cb3 it somebody hit it\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how low it sank but tonight we're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about it\cb1 \
\cb3 what should you tell them what would you\cb1 \
\cb3 tell your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 and tonight we're not worried about\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on with the women tonight\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking the women what you would tell\cb1 \
\cb3 the men\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling the men they should\cb1 \
\cb3 do what should they do ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm just communicating what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 hearing from my clients\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've heard from men over the last\cb1 \
\cb3 decades\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm asking you ladies what you would\cb1 \
\cb3 tell these men they should do\cb1 \
\cb3 actionable advice not\cb1 \
\cb3 just pray not just keep keep\cb1 \
\cb3 hope alive and you will find\cb1 \
\cb3 the uh one out of five\cb1 \
\cb3 black women that are in shape and\cb1 \
\cb3 pray to god that she is unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 no children sane\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean we're just talking about fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 if you find the one out of\cb1 \
\cb3 one out of five that's just in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 she's still got to be unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 no kids same\cb1 \
\cb3 we haven't even adjusted for looks yet\cb1 \
\cb3 that what are the numbers twenty million\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 eighty percent overweight tadama drops\cb1 \
\cb3 from twenty to four million\cb1 \
\cb3 four million total that's not even\cb1 \
\cb3 adjusted for age\cb1 \
\cb3 if you adjust for age from age 18 to 45\cb1 \
\cb3 you drop that number down to roughly\cb1 \
\cb3 about 1.6 million\cb1 \
\cb3 1.6 million that's not even adjusted for\cb1 \
\cb3 marital status\cb1 \
\cb3 23 20 26 or 32 percent marital rate\cb1 \
\cb3 was a 27 28 marital rate let's call it\cb1 \
\cb3 30\cb1 \
\cb3 1.6\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so for simple math you're talking around\cb1 \
\cb3 roughly eight hundred thousand\cb1 \
\cb3 let's give it a million black women that\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't my unmarried a million that are\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 and unmarried we still have enough in\cb1 \
\cb3 shape\cb1 \
\cb3 unmarried 18 to 45 a million\cb1 \
\cb3 plus or minus all right a million and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's across the united states\cb1 \
\cb3 then we still have to say unmarried in\cb1 \
\cb3 shape\cb1 \
\cb3 what percentage of those have kids\cb1 \
\cb3 then you can start going into the things\cb1 \
\cb3 like looks\cb1 \
\cb3 then you can start going into things\cb1 \
\cb3 like education\cb1 \
\cb3 uh income whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 you always talk about we're all the good\cb1 \
\cb3 men we're all the good women at\cb1 \
\cb3 the good fit women the good fit we're\cb1 \
\cb3 all the good women at and by good we\cb1 \
\cb3 mean fit and cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 we're all the good black women in fit\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 we're all the good black women that fit\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative we're all the good black\cb1 \
\cb3 women that fit\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative that's it so\cb1 \
\cb3 we it's all we talk about fit\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative and single fit cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and single\cb1 \
\cb3 fit cooperative single\cb1 \
\cb3 fcs fcs\cb1 \

\cb3 that fit their minimum basic standard\cb1 \
\cb3 four of them have found them in my group\cb1 \

\cb3 simple explanation\cb1 \
\cb3 the black women black women won't give\cb1 \
\cb3 the black men that they say they want\cb1 \
\cb3 what they want see you the women say\cb1 \
\cb3 they want men who are\cb1 \
\cb3 but have resources competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 productive\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to pay the cost to be the boss\cb1 \
\cb3 traditional all these other kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 things\cb1 \

\cb3 was done\cb1 \
\cb3 versus uh who's proposing to you\cb1 \

\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to know why your big head ass\cb1 \

\cb3 since you since you're supposed to be\cb1 \
\cb3 the and all\cb1 \

\cb3 can't your big head ass find a man\cb1 \
\cb3 huh why not\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you find one you're the\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd you're a phd and right\cb1 \
\cb3 you're everything a man is supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 want more then why can't you find one\cb1 \
\cb3 but you sure gotta hmm right\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard some of the stupidest\cb1 \
\cb3 arguments but all i want to hear from\cb1 \
\cb3 these women making these arguments\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you find your man now don't\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about the collective\cb1 \
\cb3 and what's going on on the moon and out\cb1 \
\cb3 in the you know\cb1 \
\cb3 a delta quadrant you know what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on in the ninth\cb1 \
\cb3 you know around you know the the rings\cb1 \
\cb3 of saturn no\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you seem to get your ball head\cb1 \
\cb3 ass man\cb1 \
\cb3 um because this is what men and black\cb1 \
\cb3 men have heard\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over and over and over again\cb1 \
\cb3 that either if you are out there\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful this your abusive cheater uh\cb1 \
\cb3 down low gay or you're dating out so oh\cb1 \
\cb3 well then why shouldn't they\cb1 \
\cb3 since since either they don't exist and\cb1 \
\cb3 when they do exist you find something\cb1 \
\cb3 wrong with them\cb1 \
\cb3 why should they stay what would you tell\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 how inviting does it brother says it\cb1 \
\cb3 seems like a civil war\cb1 \
\cb3 why why would you be a war with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the war what's the war about i\cb1 \
\cb3 thought the war was there were no\cb1 \
\cb3 there were no men but now you're showing\cb1 \
\cb3 that men exist\cb1 \
\cb3 and then if you get one in four are\cb1 \
\cb3 marrying in their lifetime if one in\cb1 \
\cb3 four black women are marrying in their\cb1 \
\cb3 lifetime\cb1 \
\cb3 and we got a 51 percent divorce rate\cb1 \
\cb3 that's higher than that in the black\cb1 \
\cb3 community\cb1 \
\cb3 but i don't know the number so i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 take the low number if the number is\cb1 \
\cb3 still 51 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 if the number still holds\cb1 \
\cb3 why 8 out of 10 of those divorces being\cb1 \
\cb3 found by black women\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're the least married\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you defiling divorce at a rate\cb1 \
\cb3 four times higher than your men\cb1 \
\cb3 so even if a black man did stay around\cb1 \
\cb3 would a black woman stay with him\cb1 \
\cb3 how many times have you guys heard on my\cb1 \
\cb3 show how long were you with the guy i\cb1 \
\cb3 was with the guy for two years four\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 why didn't you get married well\cb1 \

\cb3 uh who ended it i did\cb1 \
\cb3 i ended it how many times we hear this i\cb1 \
\cb3 ended it why oh i ended it i ended it\cb1 \
\cb3 and then you ended why did you end it\cb1 \
\cb3 especially the marriage and all of a\cb1 \
\cb3 sudden why'd you end it\cb1 \
\cb3 oh cause it got abusive all of a sudden\cb1 \
\cb3 all these men out here just\cb1 \
\cb3 black women all of a sudden we've had an\cb1 \
\cb3 epidemic of black men who get married to\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and they just apparently just whooping\cb1 \
\cb3 ass from coast to coast\cb1 \

\cb3 we're talking about the kind and caliber\cb1 \
\cb3 of men that you say you want\cb1 \
\cb3 that definitely other women of other\cb1 \
\cb3 races want\cb1 \
\cb3 and they're sneaking over here they're\cb1 \
\cb3 tiptoeing over into enemy territory\cb1 \
\cb3 and doing like the invasion of their\cb1 \

\cb3 women stop and say hold up\cb1 \
\cb3 we need to call a timeout and address\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 with this situation because see you're\cb1 \
\cb3 used to complaining on the baby boomers\cb1 \
\cb3 and generation x and crack and white\cb1 \
\cb3 supremacy and i was like what about\cb1 \
\cb3 what about the young boys the guys who\cb1 \
\cb3 are just starting dating\cb1 \

\cb3 gonna have to start having some answers\cb1 \
\cb3 for these men\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want to be fit you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to be cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell these men they\cb1 \

\cb3 let's open the call lines because i know\cb1 \
\cb3 it is gonna be smoking and again\cb1 \
\cb3 remember you're gonna be telling the\cb1 \
\cb3 guys what they should do\cb1 \
\cb3 not me them\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get it\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 money works\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 foreign\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies only ladies only ladies only\cb1 \
\cb3 what i really want to hear from you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies what would you tell your brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 they should do your brother your blood\cb1 \
\cb3 brother what would you tell him he\cb1 \
\cb3 should do\cb1 \
\cb3 now i understand something i'll be nice\cb1 \
\cb3 to you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're nice to me but don't come in\cb1 \
\cb3 here acting crazy because\cb1 \
\cb3 men really want to know what you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 think they should do because\cb1 \
\cb3 it doesn't seem like many sisters want\cb1 \
\cb3 brothers to do much anything other than\cb1 \
\cb3 weight\cb1 \
\cb3 indefinitely hear women talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm getting myself in shape okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 how long should it take to get yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 hello i'll mute yourself please\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm good\cb1 \
\cb3 you got it um so\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess what i wanted to first i wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 to respond to the first thing you said\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 how long a black black men should wait\cb1 \
\cb3 on black women\cb1 \
\cb3 oh just a second i want to make sure\cb1 \
\cb3 that i'm off mute\cb1 \
\cb3 uh go do test test test test\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead go ahead okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so um yeah so yeah what i wanted to say\cb1 \
\cb3 is that\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i don't know i think black men\cb1 \
\cb3 need to\cb1 \
\cb3 start dating seriously when they're\cb1 \
\cb3 younger as opposed to waiting to their\cb1 \
\cb3 middle age\cb1 \
\cb3 ready to start a family and just okay\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on they should start dating\cb1 \
\cb3 cert in their youth staying seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 younger like the way asians do where\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the man and woman both dating\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously at younger ages\cb1 \
\cb3 um because i think that gives you more\cb1 \
\cb3 time to find somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 when they get you like out of college\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um i i know most people start doing\cb1 \
\cb3 they're out of\cb1 \
\cb3 training or most people start they start\cb1 \
\cb3 dating at 16 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm saying dating seriously like\cb1 \
\cb3 dating to mary if you know you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be married\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is most people start how\cb1 \
\cb3 old are you 22.\cb1 \
\cb3 all right you're a bit young for this so\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't know what you're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 let me tell you most people start dating\cb1 \
\cb3 the the\cb1 \
\cb3 national age is 16.\cb1 \
\cb3 most many people are already\cb1 \
\cb3 married by non-black folks are getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married between the ages of 21 and 25.\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly that's what i'm trying to say so\cb1 \
\cb3 i even i have a lot of older\cb1 \
\cb3 black male friends and a lot of them are\cb1 \
\cb3 where's your boyfriend\cb1 \
\cb3 i have a boyfriend yeah he's not here\cb1 \
\cb3 but i have a boyfriend how long you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 been together\cb1 \
\cb3 we've been together four months\cb1 \
\cb3 four months are you wanting to get\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay does he want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay and he's older so okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so you would tell black men they need to\cb1 \
\cb3 start dating younger\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning black men black men need to date\cb1 \
\cb3 younger who would they date though\cb1 \
\cb3 they'd date black women in college not\cb1 \
\cb3 just black women but\cb1 \
\cb3 they but they did black women in college\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't the one no you can't kimmy\cb1 \
\cb3 why not okay okay\cb1 \
\cb3 do you think these that i'm just making\cb1 \
\cb3 this up no i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 care apparently you don't understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that many\cb1 \
\cb3 many women your age aren't trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with guys\cb1 \
\cb3 your age because they're broke\cb1 \
\cb3 how does your boyfriend\cb1 \
\cb3 38\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for making my point i tried\cb1 \
\cb3 a guy your age i tried that and he\cb1 \
\cb3 wasted my time\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you mean he wasted your time\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 we so i dated this guy for a year and\cb1 \
\cb3 then he decided that\cb1 \
\cb3 he wanted to do his own thing okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 well here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not going to try to get into what\cb1 \
\cb3 went on with your relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 you're kind of young for this but here's\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing black men do want to date\cb1 \
\cb3 thing is women your age in general\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't trying to date younger guys\cb1 \
\cb3 because young guys are broke\cb1 \
\cb3 so you end up wanting older guys which\cb1 \
\cb3 is fine\cb1 \
\cb3 um as long as you're dating towards\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage and you're 38 years old you're\cb1 \
\cb3 out 22\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah has he met your parents\cb1 \
\cb3 uh not yet\cb1 \

\cb3 shouldn't be anywhere near you unless\cb1 \
\cb3 he's trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 but we're working on this it's not we\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't we ain't working on\cb1 \
\cb3 he's a 40 year old man you're 22. he\cb1 \
\cb3 should know\cb1 \
\cb3 have ring in pocket step into a 22 year\cb1 \
\cb3 old woman\cb1 \
\cb3 see you need to call back on another\cb1 \
\cb3 show because here's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 first up yes you need to start dating\cb1 \
\cb3 younger\cb1 \
\cb3 but black men can't date younger because\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't date black women because\cb1 \
\cb3 black women ain't trying to check for\cb1 \
\cb3 black men because they want\cb1 \
\cb3 me with money in the bag and all this\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of stuff and you don't have that\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're your age\cb1 \
\cb3 number one but number two let's shift\cb1 \
\cb3 gears where's your daddy at\cb1 \
\cb3 um you're not around can't be around you\cb1 \
\cb3 know he's gonna be around cannot be\cb1 \
\cb3 around cause you're dating a 40 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 dude\cb1 \
\cb3 problem number one did you this guy that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're dating did he step to you with\cb1 \
\cb3 the intention of marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yes did you make did you make\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage a requirement before you went\cb1 \
\cb3 out on a date with him\cb1 \
\cb3 um no but no you did not then then\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't then you cannot be sure where\cb1 \
\cb3 he's going\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i asked you about your\cb1 \
\cb3 parents\cb1 \
\cb3 because a man that 38 years old around\cb1 \
\cb3 28 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 22 year old young lady uh he shouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 be around you unless\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to get married and he\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't want to get married but if you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 but we we haven't even slept together\cb1 \
\cb3 yet so that's another thing i don't give\cb1 \
\cb3 a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously okay i don't care okay\cb1 \
\cb3 fall back watch the show he needs to be\cb1 \
\cb3 this man needs to be vetted\cb1 \
\cb3 he needs to be vetted by men and you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to fall back and watch some more\cb1 \

\cb3 can call me\cb1 \
\cb3 if you got a problem with it bruh you\cb1 \
\cb3 can call me i'll take your call\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't i think that as a as a 38 year\cb1 \
\cb3 old man\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be very clear on why you're\cb1 \
\cb3 missing dealing with a woman younger\cb1 \
\cb3 than you\cb1 \
\cb3 if it's just a physical thing and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 not looking to be married\cb1 \
\cb3 she's looking for a fun and and somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 a date older and they have new\cb1 \
\cb3 experiences that's fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't play with young women\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to get married especially as a\cb1 \
\cb3 man that age\cb1 \
\cb3 you need your if you're playing\cb1 \
\cb3 games\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so let's get on to it\cb1 \
\cb3 karma hello\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm mute hey how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 very well how are you doing i'm good\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell me in that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should high value or success successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high value me and mary\cb1 \
\cb3 out\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 yes okay why\cb1 \
\cb3 because if they worked\cb1 \
\cb3 hard enough and long enough\cb1 \
\cb3 their purpose was to be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 get anything they want okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so whatever they want they can buy\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have sons three\cb1 \
\cb3 uh makes sense\cb1 \
\cb3 um now how does the youngest\cb1 \
\cb3 11 how does the oldest 21\cb1 \
\cb3 um would you prefer that they marry\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely um absolutely\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and the middle one is how old\cb1 \
\cb3 15. so the 21 year old what is he\cb1 \
\cb3 telling you dating is like for him\cb1 \
\cb3 with black women oh no\cb1 \
\cb3 okay here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 if you know what the experience oh i\cb1 \
\cb3 know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i just want you to see it it's it's it's\cb1 \
\cb3 invigorating because\cb1 \
\cb3 when he tells me about his dating\cb1 \
\cb3 choices\cb1 \
\cb3 i go back to what i\cb1 \
\cb3 instilled in him as a baby\cb1 \
\cb3 until where he is right now okay but\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 what he tells me is oh my god\cb1 \
\cb3 okay like he has a type and she is not\cb1 \
\cb3 black she is not brown as me\cb1 \
\cb3 she does not have the texture of hair\cb1 \
\cb3 as i do she is more of a\cb1 \
\cb3 mixed uh\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you say it like a long hair\cb1 \
\cb3 light skin yeah uh\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the things they talk about in\cb1 \
\cb3 america we kind of call that\cb1 \
\cb3 racially ambiguous but a lot of women\cb1 \
\cb3 who are latina\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of fit that prototype or a\cb1 \
\cb3 fair-skinned black woman but but the\cb1 \
\cb3 thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 what is why is he choosing these women\cb1 \
\cb3 because they bring\cb1 \
\cb3 he told me he said mom and i don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 into his business\cb1 \
\cb3 i just kind of listen to what he says\cb1 \
\cb3 and the pictures that he chooses to show\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 and so that's when i learned he had a\cb1 \
\cb3 type and what he says is that\cb1 \
\cb3 in our in our community which is\cb1 \
\cb3 predominantly\cb1 \
\cb3 black and\cb1 \
\cb3 the young girls that are his age\cb1 \
\cb3 are nasty\cb1 \
\cb3 and they are black and i'm sorry to say\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 nasty what do you mean nasty anywhere\cb1 \
\cb3 they look dirty they got a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 tattoos\cb1 \
\cb3 hair from weave and wigs\cb1 \
\cb3 cursing they don't cook\cb1 \
\cb3 um so do you know what happens so bad\cb1 \
\cb3 body type\cb1 \
\cb3 let me ask you some questions as the as\cb1 \
\cb3 the mother of three boys do you know any\cb1 \
\cb3 mothers of daughters\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have any friends who have\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters yes yes yes yes yes but what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you talk to\cb1 \
\cb3 the women about their daughters because\cb1 \
\cb3 their daughters should be\cb1 \
\cb3 being raised for you can't i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't tell them anything they're\cb1 \
\cb3 getting tattoos\cb1 \
\cb3 i said uh hold on let me let me stop\cb1 \
\cb3 right here though because we have\cb1 \
\cb3 something you got three boys\cb1 \
\cb3 and your oldest is basically saying i\cb1 \
\cb3 see you mom\cb1 \
\cb3 but the women the black women are not\cb1 \
\cb3 like you\cb1 \
\cb3 they're they're you use the word nasty\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna say unappealing\cb1 \
\cb3 um okay uh and i want to pick\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to stick on the\cb1 \
\cb3 the uh attitudinal things the attitudes\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the the cursing the uh\cb1 \
\cb3 inability to cooperate not really want\cb1 \
\cb3 to cook or anything like that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh because the other ones can be\cb1 \

\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm calling because um what you said\cb1 \
\cb3 resonated i have a brother he's adopted\cb1 \
\cb3 but\cb1 \
\cb3 very much my blood um and i recently\cb1 \
\cb3 went to his wedding uh two months ago\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was an interracial wedding\cb1 \
\cb3 and um he started talking to me very\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 about wanting to be married i would say\cb1 \
\cb3 about eight years ago i was already\cb1 \
\cb3 married i've been married 11 years to my\cb1 \
\cb3 college sweetheart and\cb1 \
\cb3 we have three kids at home school so\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're when you're describing stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 like what these women want i'm like yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 it's possible and it's entirely possible\cb1 \
\cb3 but you it's better to start young um\cb1 \
\cb3 but anyway so my brother\cb1 \
\cb3 he had been trying to date in his race\cb1 \
\cb3 and um it just wasn't it wasn't hidden\cb1 \
\cb3 the women were\cb1 \
\cb3 very demanding but not very giving and\cb1 \
\cb3 he would come to me\cb1 \
\cb3 and he would say you know what should i\cb1 \
\cb3 do and\cb1 \
\cb3 to me my brother is like you can't get\cb1 \
\cb3 no better than my brother he's lost\cb1 \
\cb3 captain in the army is he older or he's\cb1 \
\cb3 younger he's one year younger\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so he's law school captain in the\cb1 \
\cb3 military\cb1 \
\cb3 you know getting ready to take company\cb1 \
\cb3 command\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape tall slim you know all the\cb1 \
\cb3 things\cb1 \
\cb3 straight out of central casting out of a\cb1 \
\cb3 movie he's he's wonderful but of course\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm biased he's my brother\cb1 \
\cb3 um and so anyway like i would say three\cb1 \
\cb3 years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 he came to me very cautious we were\cb1 \
\cb3 actually on a hike and we had gone up\cb1 \
\cb3 this mountain he was like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what do you think about me\cb1 \
\cb3 dating outside\cb1 \
\cb3 of our race and i was like i think\cb1 \
\cb3 what's taking you so long you you're\cb1 \
\cb3 getting oh you're oh mate we're from the\cb1 \
\cb3 south what's taking me so long\cb1 \
\cb3 and um you know he went for it and the\cb1 \
\cb3 first\cb1 \
\cb3 woman he dated outside of his race ended\cb1 \
\cb3 up accusing him\cb1 \
\cb3 of being all the things he wasn't she\cb1 \
\cb3 had even set up a marriage registry\cb1 \
\cb3 on um like a website before he'd even\cb1 \
\cb3 proposed because i\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought i i was you know doing some\cb1 \
\cb3 fact checking on her and i looked him up\cb1 \
\cb3 and i looked her up and she had posted a\cb1 \
\cb3 wedding date he had not proposed but i\cb1 \
\cb3 called him immediately and said did you\cb1 \
\cb3 propose and not tell me\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 um yeah crazy well crazy comes in all\cb1 \
\cb3 colors but he\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah she got past her yeah but but\cb1 \
\cb3 he's married now though right he is\cb1 \
\cb3 married now she's wonderful how long\cb1 \
\cb3 have they been married\cb1 \
\cb3 just two months like they got married\cb1 \
\cb3 correctly though when\cb1 \
\cb3 your brother came to you kind of tepid\cb1 \
\cb3 or sheepish\cb1 \
\cb3 about asking you about this\cb1 \
\cb3 right yeah how do you think that it is\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 we're from the south so it's it's and\cb1 \
\cb3 even though we have relatives who have\cb1 \
\cb3 been in interracial marriages it's\cb1 \
\cb3 harder like i think i heard you mention\cb1 \
\cb3 on a different show it is harder you\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 different experiences when you marry\cb1 \
\cb3 someone outside your race\cb1 \
\cb3 well he came to you he came to his older\cb1 \
\cb3 sister\cb1 \
\cb3 in a position because he didn't know how\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to take it\cb1 \
\cb3 and you said why aren't you why why\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't you\cb1 \
\cb3 already married you know i think i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 why aren't you already what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 already why are you doing something\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hey all right hey hold on like\cb1 \
\cb3 this second\cb1 \
\cb3 i gotta play ike song real quick i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know if you don't know if you heard this\cb1 \
\cb3 all right you didn't hear your remix man\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody remixed your song\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 i am the king you will not be\cb1 \
\cb3 all right i had to play that but see i\cb1 \
\cb3 think it shows the difference that black\cb1 \
\cb3 men still have for black women that even\cb1 \
\cb3 he stepped his sister in a way it was\cb1 \
\cb3 like i don't know how she's gonna take\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're like bruh i think the world\cb1 \
\cb3 of you and you sure did this a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 ago\cb1 \
\cb3 and i think that's a good thing to tell\cb1 \
\cb3 them but um\cb1 \
\cb3 have you always felt that way or did you\cb1 \
\cb3 just kind of start to realize that\cb1 \
\cb3 hey man there's not a lot of good\cb1 \
\cb3 choices out here for a man like my\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i realized it more with uh my\cb1 \
\cb3 husband\cb1 \
\cb3 has a lot of single friends who\cb1 \
\cb3 i i think you would consider them\cb1 \
\cb3 henry's\cb1 \
\cb3 they're all high earners they're they're\cb1 \
\cb3 good guys and\cb1 \
\cb3 they're all still single and looking\cb1 \
\cb3 and i i would i guess i didn't notice it\cb1 \
\cb3 at the beginning of our marriage because\cb1 \
\cb3 we got married very young we were 22\cb1 \
\cb3 just out of college right right\cb1 \
\cb3 um so i didn't pay attention to it then\cb1 \
\cb3 because i felt like we\cb1 \
\cb3 we were like i said abnormal for getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married young\cb1 \
\cb3 you know yeah we're normal as french\cb1 \
\cb3 toast that wasn't the right thing to do\cb1 \
\cb3 [Laughter]\cb1 \
\cb3 but like when we were starting to get to\cb1 \
\cb3 be 26 27 i'm like why haven't you been\cb1 \
\cb3 in anybody's wedding like what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on with your friends why aren't they\cb1 \
\cb3 getting married\cb1 \
\cb3 and my husband would just say like oh\cb1 \
\cb3 well they're dating\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh yeah they're not they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 settling down\cb1 \
\cb3 and occasionally like me and my husband\cb1 \
\cb3 our last name is right as you can see so\cb1 \
\cb3 we're we're called the right house and\cb1 \
\cb3 people bring their\cb1 \
\cb3 significant others to the right house\cb1 \
\cb3 basically for i don't want to say\cb1 \
\cb3 but but to run it by us before they take\cb1 \
\cb3 it to their parents because we're like\cb1 \
\cb3 the old\cb1 \
\cb3 people of our friend group well here's\cb1 \
\cb3 what i need you to do me anybody need to\cb1 \
\cb3 do do me as this\cb1 \
\cb3 i need you to send me an email i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 do a follow-up broadcast of this\cb1 \
\cb3 but i need to keep cycling through this\cb1 \
\cb3 i think this is a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation that actually we can kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of build on and i'm gonna need some\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 other than just myself because this\cb1 \
\cb3 platform\cb1 \
\cb3 i i run the channel but it's gonna be\cb1 \
\cb3 bigger than me\cb1 \
\cb3 and i need folks that like you that have\cb1 \
\cb3 lived it got credibility to speak about\cb1 \
\cb3 it so\cb1 \
\cb3 it could be more received by other\cb1 \
\cb3 people can you do that for me\cb1 \
\cb3 um sure i'm gonna i'll put my my email\cb1 \
\cb3 address\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the moderators will put it in in the\cb1 \
\cb3 chat room okay\cb1 \
\cb3 okay sounds good all right thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 miss right bye-bye uh\cb1 \
\cb3 all right look um\cb1 \
\cb3 you know my guess is\cb1 \
\cb3 no black woman wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 have to think that their son or their\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 would be damn near forced to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 outside of black women that's just not\cb1 \
\cb3 how human beings are\cb1 \
\cb3 our brains are set up we're set up to\cb1 \
\cb3 want to pick ourselves\cb1 \
\cb3 so when i say that a lot of times\cb1 \
\cb3 brothers are\cb1 \
\cb3 uh brothers are very loyal that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 sarah unreached yourself i laughed when\cb1 \
\cb3 i heard somebody say women sisters are\cb1 \
\cb3 more loyal i'm like i think if black\cb1 \
\cb3 women could\cb1 \
\cb3 date out like black men many of them\cb1 \
\cb3 would have done it just my opinion sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 should uh should competitive or\cb1 \
\cb3 successful high value men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 if they can't find um potential spouses\cb1 \
\cb3 in their race\cb1 \
\cb3 they cannot find yeah if they cannot but\cb1 \
\cb3 if they if they can if it's possible\cb1 \
\cb3 then yes but\cb1 \
\cb3 i will admit it's very difficult to find\cb1 \
\cb3 good matches\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly even in my experience just\cb1 \
\cb3 having friends\cb1 \
\cb3 is difficult so marrying\cb1 \
\cb3 me i did ask this question earlier sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 so maybe you could answer it for me um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you just had a ballpark how many how\cb1 \
\cb3 many people should you date\cb1 \
\cb3 before you consider dating out honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe like\cb1 \
\cb3 two or three or just two or three yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 see i'm allowed i'm you laughing sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 because when i've heard\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard some black women say yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 when i hear black men talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 they did it out and i'm like well they\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't dead at all black women they've\cb1 \
\cb3 only dated like two or three and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 like well\cb1 \
\cb3 and i started thinking i'm like well how\cb1 \
\cb3 many women do these\cb1 \
\cb3 do these women think men should date\cb1 \
\cb3 before they can draw a picture i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 so it shocks me to hear you say two or\cb1 \
\cb3 three because when a man says two or\cb1 \
\cb3 three they get screamed at\cb1 \
\cb3 well honestly i feel like you can't you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't date all black women\cb1 \
\cb3 you you ha you have to meet you have to\cb1 \
\cb3 try and just date the few that you see\cb1 \
\cb3 that you find attractive but if you keep\cb1 \
\cb3 running on blanks then maybe it's time\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 expand well how about how about this\cb1 \
\cb3 i think that when a man becomes\cb1 \
\cb3 successful and competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 that women make themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of in his presence\cb1 \
\cb3 that's very true i think i mean i've\cb1 \
\cb3 seen that men pick\cb1 \
\cb3 from the women that are around that's\cb1 \
\cb3 why boaz are ruth in the bible\cb1 \
\cb3 you know boaz didn't go looking for ruth\cb1 \
\cb3 ruth was happening to be around\cb1 \
\cb3 so um thank you for adding that in uh\cb1 \
\cb3 miss henson has something she wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 add\cb1 \
\cb3 sarah can you hold on just a second okay\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and get miss henson in here\cb1 \
\cb3 miss henson\cb1 \
\cb3 you got your hand raised so you must\cb1 \
\cb3 want to give it to me all right miss\cb1 \
\cb3 henson go ahead don't meet yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 hi you need to mute\cb1 \
\cb3 the youtube channels and things in the\cb1 \
\cb3 background\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so yeah what do you got for me on\cb1 \
\cb3 the topic\cb1 \
\cb3 um so i think that you're right i think\cb1 \
\cb3 that no high value black men should wait\cb1 \
\cb3 around\cb1 \
\cb3 because i think the exact same thing for\cb1 \
\cb3 black women i actually just had a friend\cb1 \
\cb3 who married outside of his race i went\cb1 \
\cb3 to their wedding about two years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 he did marry a white woman beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 couple and he is a\cb1 \
\cb3 captain now he is a policeman and\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought that it was beautiful but\cb1 \
\cb3 again where he lives he lives out in\cb1 \
\cb3 boston there isn't a lot of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 to choose from and the ones that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know they're already choose from you\cb1 \
\cb3 know you have to take your pick and so\cb1 \
\cb3 yes he did marry\cb1 \
\cb3 a white woman but i i thought that the\cb1 \
\cb3 union was beautiful so i'm gonna tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you right now i've had a couple in my\cb1 \
\cb3 group\cb1 \
\cb3 get together and she's in boston and\cb1 \
\cb3 he's in atlanta but they met in my group\cb1 \
\cb3 or else they never would have crossed\cb1 \
\cb3 paths\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you mentioned something about\cb1 \
\cb3 successful competitive and high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men i think the successful competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value women have the same options\cb1 \
\cb3 as well\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the trick um it's the\cb1 \
\cb3 i think everybody understands that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should not wait the problem is these\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 these these two successful groups of\cb1 \
\cb3 people don't seem to be able to find one\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 do you think that's possible do you\cb1 \
\cb3 think that could be it\cb1 \
\cb3 she muted herself go ahead and mute\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i absolutely think that's it because\cb1 \
\cb3 you might have a successful black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that's in california who's doing really\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 she may be working her way up in a\cb1 \
\cb3 company you may have another black man\cb1 \
\cb3 that's\cb1 \
\cb3 over in seattle and so\cb1 \
\cb3 we're placed all over the country right\cb1 \
\cb3 and so we may not\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna tell you miss hanson i really\cb1 \
\cb3 wouldn't i didn't that group i made on\cb1 \
\cb3 facebook was just kind of like on a\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i'm just trying and when i\cb1 \
\cb3 say four couples have met\cb1 \
\cb3 in 90 days and one's talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage and none of them are in the\cb1 \
\cb3 same city\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm like i agree with you 100 about\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 me and myself i'm single i'm 27. um i\cb1 \
\cb3 won't say what city or state i live in\cb1 \
\cb3 it's okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but definitely i'm working my way way up\cb1 \
\cb3 i just had an interview at four today\cb1 \
\cb3 with a very established luxury retailer\cb1 \
\cb3 and so\cb1 \
\cb3 of course i'm looking for somebody who\cb1 \
\cb3 can bring a lot to the table\cb1 \
\cb3 like what you're saying and so as a 27\cb1 \
\cb3 year old i just went to the gym today\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm keeping myself\cb1 \
\cb3 up and i have an interest in black men\cb1 \
\cb3 as well as other races\cb1 \
\cb3 but bringing it back to black men is\cb1 \
\cb3 that what that is what we're talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 and as far as my friend goes he met his\cb1 \
\cb3 wife in boston she's gorgeous she's\cb1 \
\cb3 white the union was beautiful and he\cb1 \
\cb3 found who was\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean she was fit she's gorgeous she's\cb1 \
\cb3 you know\cb1 \
\cb3 like you said like you mean\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i you know it's a hard pill to\cb1 \
\cb3 swallow but it is what it is as far as\cb1 \
\cb3 me i'm keeping myself up and i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have a victim\cb1 \
\cb3 mindset what about let me let me say\cb1 \
\cb3 this while i get on to the next person\cb1 \
\cb3 i would consider a matchmaker\cb1 \
\cb3 matchmakers is one thing that i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think enough people consider\cb1 \
\cb3 uh because in effect that's kind of what\cb1 \
\cb3 happened in my group it was a match make\cb1 \
\cb3 of sorts\cb1 \
\cb3 and i you know um if you're if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 moving on up\cb1 \
\cb3 as you say yes uh yes it's about\cb1 \
\cb3 it's about the connections more than\cb1 \
\cb3 anything else i got more people coming\cb1 \
\cb3 in\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for uh adding to the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation i'm going to drop you back\cb1 \
\cb3 in\cb1 \
\cb3 uh thank you um buck\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't pronounce your name i don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 it wrong uh\cb1 \
\cb3 hi i'm mute yourself hi there how you\cb1 \
\cb3 doing kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm well um so the question is should\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 so i think that's a really tough\cb1 \
\cb3 question right because\cb1 \
\cb3 on that one i want to be logical right\cb1 \
\cb3 the logical answer is to just say yes\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but i mean i just feel like we can't\cb1 \
\cb3 really give up on one another\cb1 \
\cb3 because black men and black women i\cb1 \
\cb3 think of us as a unit\cb1 \
\cb3 so um i i mean i understand the\cb1 \
\cb3 situation like in the dating market but\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 like to hear when people make you sound\cb1 \
\cb3 as though there are no good black women\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's the same thing from the other\cb1 \
\cb3 side as well you know sometimes you hear\cb1 \
\cb3 black women talking and you're like okay\cb1 \
\cb3 please stop so i mean the logical answer\cb1 \
\cb3 to your question is yes of course you\cb1 \
\cb3 know do what's best\cb1 \
\cb3 you said you don't like to see us give\cb1 \
\cb3 up on one another\cb1 \
\cb3 um yeah all right how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 35 okay so you're old enough to\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to answer this question you know\cb1 \
\cb3 how i framed it\cb1 \
\cb3 right um 80 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 of black women are overweight\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i'm sorry i\cb1 \
\cb3 i gotta ask who's give who who do you\cb1 \
\cb3 think gave up first\cb1 \
\cb3 um i mean i think that's this is your\cb1 \
\cb3 opinion now i'm not gonna hold you to\cb1 \
\cb3 stats here\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i mean yeah if you think about it\cb1 \
\cb3 in that sense\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah black women can be more competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 i've never\cb1 \
\cb3 heard that stat before so it's quite an\cb1 \
\cb3 issue\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah it's like everywhere i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i definitely think that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 but i also think that's a situation that\cb1 \
\cb3 can be remedied right\cb1 \
\cb3 it can be but\cb1 \
\cb3 if if men are just asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 fit cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 single women right it's not much\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not and i don't know what region\cb1 \
\cb3 of the country you live in but\cb1 \
\cb3 get out huh houston i live in houston\cb1 \
\cb3 texas well then\cb1 \
\cb3 i l so i know think i know you can walk\cb1 \
\cb3 around houston and see\cb1 \
\cb3 the average sister is not a dress size\cb1 \
\cb3 four\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so i hear you say you don't give up\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you're a man who's already gone\cb1 \
\cb3 out and done the things he needs to do\cb1 \
\cb3 to be competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 what's he picking from and even if they\cb1 \
\cb3 are in the fit category are they getting\cb1 \
\cb3 a cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 i hear what you're saying here's what i\cb1 \
\cb3 would like i would like black women to\cb1 \
\cb3 be more competitive i would like black\cb1 \
\cb3 women to say all right\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to give the black man what he\cb1 \
\cb3 wants cooperation and fitness and single\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to do that for him because see\cb1 \
\cb3 we tell a lot we tell women a lot you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need to work out for me and i say\cb1 \
\cb3 yes you do\cb1 \
\cb3 because i need to work for a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you're goddamn right i can't have a\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful woman and no money\cb1 \
\cb3 makes sense i mean these suits cost\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean oh and i can't walk around so i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 we we need you say we're we're you say\cb1 \
\cb3 you think of us as a unit or our team\cb1 \
\cb3 mm-hmm i would i would say that that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not our culture\cb1 \
\cb3 our country we're a bunch of individuals\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm i'm um i'm nigerian i don't know if\cb1 \
\cb3 you can tell yeah i can't and\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i i definitely find that to be true\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a lot of you know divisiveness\cb1 \
\cb3 well in order but i think you're only\cb1 \
\cb3 something though in order to get\cb1 \
\cb3 on the same page we have to think about\cb1 \
\cb3 ourselves as a team\cb1 \
\cb3 because in that case you do things for\cb1 \
\cb3 your teammates\cb1 \
\cb3 that you may not necessarily do for\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah that's fair okay let me go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 and cycle through\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 i had you there sarah camille i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 get you\cb1 \
\cb3 camille go ahead good evening kevin how\cb1 \
\cb3 are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm good um should single competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful high value men marry out what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have for me\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm i'm i'm oh god\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 52 years old okay and i've been\cb1 \

\cb3 21 years uh met and married\cb1 \
\cb3 in about a year when i met my husband my\cb1 \
\cb3 best friend met and married in four\cb1 \
\cb3 months\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly it don't take all that long now\cb1 \
\cb3 does it it don't take that long at\cb1 \
\cb3 all these women they come into a\cb1 \
\cb3 situation and i\cb1 \
\cb3 understood i was turning 30\cb1 \
\cb3 31 between 30 and 32 and i understood\cb1 \
\cb3 the clock was ticking and something just\cb1 \
\cb3 said\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to be married you've got to\cb1 \
\cb3 get out here and get out here seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was an internal thing that just\cb1 \
\cb3 told me that i knew high risk pregnancy\cb1 \
\cb3 was 35\cb1 \
\cb3 so i got no business trying to have kids\cb1 \
\cb3 or meet a man at 35\cb1 \
\cb3 after my career is established right but\cb1 \
\cb3 the sad thing is i'm a special ed\cb1 \
\cb3 teacher right now\cb1 \
\cb3 and i have women on my caseload in their\cb1 \
\cb3 20s with seven kids each\cb1 \
\cb3 and they don't even report we're virtual\cb1 \
\cb3 right now they don't report the kids i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not coming to school someone i got to\cb1 \
\cb3 work\cb1 \
\cb3 i got to do this and i'm real harsh\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'll tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the women you know we're\cb1 \
\cb3 preparing these boys\cb1 \
\cb3 to be married to grow up and be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 take care of themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 and you are not and this is a team\cb1 \
\cb3 effort\cb1 \
\cb3 right but they're busy and a lot of them\cb1 \
\cb3 are my friends on facebook they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 even know it and i'm looking at pictures\cb1 \
\cb3 posted up holding bottles\cb1 \
\cb3 stinking weaves in a hair salon i have\cb1 \
\cb3 never had a weave in my head my children\cb1 \
\cb3 have never had weeds and i'm a hair\cb1 \
\cb3 stylist\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all gonna y'all gonna y'all gonna get\cb1 \
\cb3 me shot talk about these stinky weaves\cb1 \
\cb3 but i know\cb1 \
\cb3 i know and why not be you beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 as it is and so now my only son is 13.\cb1 \
\cb3 i have daughters three daughters 17 26\cb1 \
\cb3 and 30.\cb1 \
\cb3 that i don't have any grandchildren i\cb1 \
\cb3 taught them it's a marriage first\cb1 \
\cb3 and then if you don't get married then\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have children that's just how\cb1 \
\cb3 it goes\cb1 \
\cb3 right um so my 13 year old lady i had a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation with him\cb1 \
\cb3 because i was lit he listened to your\cb1 \
\cb3 show with me in the car on the way\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 13 year old yes my son he listens\cb1 \
\cb3 to you\cb1 \
\cb3 with me and i asked him the question you\cb1 \
\cb3 had a 24 year old girl\cb1 \
\cb3 on your show and she had a child when\cb1 \
\cb3 she was 14\cb1 \
\cb3 yes so i turned and i asked him i said\cb1 \
\cb3 if you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you make it to the nfl or when you do\cb1 \
\cb3 i said would you date her\cb1 \
\cb3 and he said no he's 13 never dated\cb1 \
\cb3 and i said why he said because i have\cb1 \
\cb3 other options\cb1 \
\cb3 as a 13 year old he understood that\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 and the single biggest mistake black\cb1 \
\cb3 women are making is they're having\cb1 \
\cb3 babies they're doing things out of order\cb1 \
\cb3 there's an\cb1 \
\cb3 order to everything and\cb1 \
\cb3 i try to tell women and young girls they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to listen to me but my story\cb1 \
\cb3 is so tripped out because i got that\cb1 \
\cb3 revelation like you talked about after\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact i had two daughters coming into\cb1 \
\cb3 my marriage and my husband had two sons\cb1 \
\cb3 but i understood what that cost me\cb1 \
\cb3 and i wasn't going to say they didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 cost me nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 my husband is a henry i basically stay\cb1 \
\cb3 at home\cb1 \
\cb3 i teach because i just wanted to go to\cb1 \
\cb3 work right\cb1 \
\cb3 he's an excellent black man there's some\cb1 \
\cb3 good ones out there but black women\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want the good black men\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't you you know what uh you over\cb1 \
\cb3 here going to church i'm out that past\cb1 \
\cb3 collection plate\cb1 \
\cb3 but you gave me some things i really\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to be on i need to\cb1 \
\cb3 i need to get to this other question\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah come here\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it though thank you sis thank\cb1 \
\cb3 you so much\cb1 \
\cb3 uh dang 13 years old i better i'm glad i\cb1 \
\cb3 started cleaning up my language\cb1 \
\cb3 uh sarah you had your hand up go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 did you ever\cb1 \
\cb3 unmute yourself real quick i mean um\cb1 \
\cb3 what i was going to say is that\cb1 \
\cb3 i have a friend who just got married i\cb1 \
\cb3 think last year he married an indian\cb1 \
\cb3 girl so\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and he's black so this is something\cb1 \
\cb3 that i see happening\cb1 \
\cb3 for whatever reason\cb1 \
\cb3 fitness is a problem you know i i\cb1 \
\cb3 like exercise every day whether yoga all\cb1 \
\cb3 these things but i noticed that\cb1 \
\cb3 my other women around me don't do that\cb1 \
\cb3 but at least you're remaining\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive at least i'm remaining\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 but then if i like sometimes you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 even tell them because you're worried\cb1 \
\cb3 that oh if i say something\cb1 \
\cb3 it's going to trigger them well we'll\cb1 \
\cb3 we'll\cb1 \
\cb3 we'll keep having the conversations and\cb1 \
\cb3 by and by\cb1 \
\cb3 hopefully they'll start to get the point\cb1 \
\cb3 but you keep being competitive and doing\cb1 \
\cb3 what you need to do sis\cb1 \

\cb3 in order to fix any problem you have to\cb1 \

\cb3 acknowledge it exists\cb1 \
\cb3 the kind of men that you say you want\cb1 \
\cb3 simply want\cb1 \
\cb3 fit cooperative and single\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't even say they want submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not even going to go that far\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys just want fitness is so\cb1 \
\cb3 important\cb1 \
\cb3 them on good times was thermal because\cb1 \
\cb3 she had a thelma body\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies you are you will be amazed at\cb1 \

\cb3 thing i'm still opening the call lines\cb1 \
\cb3 if you think i'm incorrect if you think\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm wrong if you think\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a bunch of bs you call in too\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll ask is that you are respectful we\cb1 \
\cb3 can have a respectful back and forth\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 but i really would like to know what you\cb1 \
\cb3 expect\cb1 \
\cb3 men to do\cb1 \
\cb3 and what i'm seeing is\cb1 \
\cb3 we're expecting competitive successful\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 to do even more work and i'm seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 most women are not doing the minimum\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a hard pill to swallow that's\cb1 \
\cb3 what a lot of the callers have said\cb1 \
\cb3 my brother is a captain in this in law\cb1 \
\cb3 school he's gone on to make himself\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 and we're talking about women in their\cb1 \
\cb3 20s who are dressed size\cb1 \
\cb3 12 and 14 and 16s and 18s you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 even doing the\cb1 \
\cb3 minimum fit\cb1 \
\cb3 the cooperative he's not asking you to\cb1 \
\cb3 be a millionaire\cb1 \
\cb3 or a brain scientist or a rocket surgeon\cb1 \
\cb3 come on\cb1 \
\cb3 nandi i can't hear you you can't i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 put you on cause there's no sound\cb1 \
\cb3 she doesn't get it let me put it in chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room maybe she'll get it in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room\cb1 \
\cb3 um so if you're not giving guys the bare\cb1 \
\cb3 minimum\cb1 \
\cb3 what are they supposed to do\cb1 \
\cb3 you have no\cb1 \
\cb3 sound no audio\cb1 \
\cb3 nandi nandi\cb1 \
\cb3 back to shock azula on your others\cb1 \
\cb3 and see the thing is i think you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i think a lot of you guys know that\cb1 \
\cb3 for the men who are out here who are\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive you can't ask them to wait\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why when i hear women say i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 addressed size 12 i'm a 14.\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm working on it i'm like i need a\cb1 \
\cb3 sense of urgency from you\cb1 \
\cb3 because while you're working on it\cb1 \
\cb3 you're wasting time\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to the uh to the miss right\cb1 \
\cb3 she said they got married at 22. good\cb1 \
\cb3 for you\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all got married when y'all was too\cb1 \
\cb3 dumb to know any better\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i was too dumb to know any better\cb1 \
\cb3 you were still living off ikea\cb1 \
\cb3 ramen noodles um\cb1 \
\cb3 lunch meat you know going to outback\cb1 \
\cb3 steakhouse was special\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all was on sleeping bags tv dinners\cb1 \
\cb3 10 pound bags of fryers kool-aid\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i'm talking about you know\cb1 \
\cb3 having sex on the on the floor because\cb1 \
\cb3 the floor was more comfortable in that\cb1 \
\cb3 cheap ass bed\cb1 \
\cb3 you know buying all the generic stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 because you couldn't afford del monte\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 it was good times\cb1 \
\cb3 living that little hubble drinking that\cb1 \
\cb3 little you know\cb1 \
\cb3 box wine and carrying on because you\cb1 \
\cb3 couldn't afford kendall jackson because\cb1 \
\cb3 you thought kendall jackson was\cb1 \
\cb3 expensive\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah she was too damn young to know any\cb1 \
\cb3 better and y'all grew up together and\cb1 \
\cb3 you got 12 or 13 or 15 years of\cb1 \
\cb3 chronicling\cb1 \
\cb3 each other's life\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's the value you know yeah you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to you want to mate that you're\cb1 \
\cb3 attracted to\cb1 \
\cb3 and sexy and also it's to chronicle your\cb1 \
\cb3 life so somebody can say i've seen this\cb1 \
\cb3 person\cb1 \
\cb3 and they have grown from here to here to\cb1 \
\cb3 here to here that's why anniversaries\cb1 \
\cb3 holidays and things like that are so\cb1 \
\cb3 important you chronicle the markers of\cb1 \
\cb3 life so when somebody transitions\cb1 \
\cb3 goes on and shuffles off this mortal\cb1 \
\cb3 coil people can say\cb1 \
\cb3 i was there through the journey right\cb1 \
\cb3 now so many of us are walking on our own\cb1 \
\cb3 journeys well competitive successful\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 they understand the network the first\cb1 \
\cb3 network is family\cb1 \
\cb3 and that is an integral part of a\cb1 \
\cb3 success\cb1 \
\cb3 for a competitive successful high value\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not worried about this scarcity\cb1 \
\cb3 demand said i'll make a million dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 and have a chick take me half that ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't come into these conversations\cb1 \
\cb3 because these men know they can go out\cb1 \
\cb3 and make it\cb1 \
\cb3 anything that they could possibly lose\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't care they're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 they can lose it in the market lose it\cb1 \
\cb3 in divorce you can lose it to go back\cb1 \
\cb3 and make it again\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys don't think like that their\cb1 \
\cb3 brain ain't set up like that all right\cb1 \
\cb3 did you like your song\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't see ike's response but ike's\cb1 \
\cb3 song is dope\cb1 \
\cb3 i am the king and will not be i\cb1 \
\cb3 am okay there's nandi okay\cb1 \
\cb3 unmute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 can you hear me now i can hear you now\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm good how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 good what you got for me um\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm so the question is should successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out i would say no\cb1 \
\cb3 okay tell me why um because you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what i have\cb1 \
\cb3 dated out and uh\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not the life it's not the life\cb1 \
\cb3 they do not offer what they would really\cb1 \
\cb3 have for a black woman they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 who's they they meaning\cb1 \
\cb3 men who are not black okay well what\cb1 \
\cb3 would you tell black men though\cb1 \
\cb3 are you telling the black men that their\cb1 \
\cb3 experience will be the same\cb1 \
\cb3 no i would tell black men that you need\cb1 \
\cb3 to stick with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 why because you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 women who are not black who are white\cb1 \
\cb3 who are asian\cb1 \
\cb3 who are hispanic they will not give you\cb1 \
\cb3 what a black woman can give you what is\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 which is the experience and the\cb1 \
\cb3 the culture they can't give you\cb1 \
\cb3 what uh what is is offered\cb1 \
\cb3 they they can give you what is outside\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on okay i know you think\cb1 \
\cb3 you're dropping knowledge\cb1 \
\cb3 but you're not really saying anything\cb1 \
\cb3 okay they cannot give you anything the\cb1 \
\cb3 culture what is the what does that mean\cb1 \
\cb3 men are very logical and so what\cb1 \
\cb3 what is a black man going to get from a\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman\cb1 \

\cb3 i agree yeah you as a black woman just\cb1 \
\cb3 said black women are not known to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay so that's one thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 argumentative\cb1 \
\cb3 so if men want cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 they cannot get it from black women\cb1 \
\cb3 according to you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well you know what not from every\cb1 \
\cb3 black one okay man but okay okay okay\cb1 \
\cb3 again\cb1 \
\cb3 again see that's see we were doing so\cb1 \
\cb3 good\cb1 \
\cb3 so now you're going to try to go into\cb1 \
\cb3 the not all\cb1 \
\cb3 no walt no ma'am let's stick in the\cb1 \
\cb3 stick in them in the general\cb1 \
\cb3 in general okay in general so\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't get cooperation what else do\cb1 \
\cb3 what else do black men want from\cb1 \
\cb3 from women uh they they want natural\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty okay and part of that is\cb1 \
\cb3 fitness fitness yes fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so so let me let me ask you a\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 okay are you aware what percentage of\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 are overweight\cb1 \
\cb3 uh gosh even even my son\cb1 \
\cb3 said that he sees a whole bunch of fat\cb1 \
\cb3 what percentage what percentage i have\cb1 \
\cb3 100\cb1 \
\cb3 what percent i'm probably\cb1 \
\cb3 about 80 yep so if 8 out of 10 or 80 out\cb1 \
\cb3 of 100\cb1 \
\cb3 black women are\cb1 \
\cb3 if they are overweight and according to\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 they are not cooperative they are not\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative so\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 those are the two things they say they\cb1 \
\cb3 want\cb1 \
\cb3 and they can't get them tell me why\cb1 \
\cb3 you're telling me why\cb1 \
\cb3 so basically what you're coming down to\cb1 \
\cb3 is your argument is just do it for\cb1 \
\cb3 blackness\cb1 \
\cb3 you know no no man listen what i'm about\cb1 \
\cb3 to say what your argument was\cb1 \
\cb3 is an impassioned argument do it for the\cb1 \
\cb3 sake of blackness just do it for the\cb1 \
\cb3 blackness\cb1 \
\cb3 now you're not going to get what you\cb1 \
\cb3 want you're not going to get cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 because we're not known for that we're\cb1 \
\cb3 known for being the opposite of\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen listen and you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to get fit because 80\cb1 \
\cb3 of us are overweight even my son says\cb1 \
\cb3 that so you're basically telling black\cb1 \
\cb3 men you shouldn't get what you want so\cb1 \
\cb3 you would tell your son\cb1 \
\cb3 that you raised kept out of trouble kept\cb1 \
\cb3 out of jail kept out of the prison\cb1 \
\cb3 kept out of the cemetery you would tell\cb1 \
\cb3 him to go get a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and spend the rest of his life with a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who has not given him what he\cb1 \
\cb3 wants\cb1 \
\cb3 jeez you know when you put it like that\cb1 \
\cb3 well that's the way i needed to put it\cb1 \
\cb3 because if i just put it out in there\cb1 \
\cb3 with men and women you could argue it\cb1 \
\cb3 but when it's your son\cb1 \
\cb3 when it's your brother then it gets real\cb1 \
\cb3 yes and you have something you would say\cb1 \
\cb3 you would tell your boy to go get a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 if he said mama i looked high and low\cb1 \
\cb3 and they all uncle they're uncooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and they're not fit\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell them to just not get\cb1 \
\cb3 anything\cb1 \
\cb3 ah okay you know that is really good\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly and this is the question your\cb1 \
\cb3 son and so many brothers are struggling\cb1 \
\cb3 with because they\cb1 \
\cb3 like black women but they can't they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't get even the basic stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my god well i want my son to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 the black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but here's what here's what's gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 happen black woman here's what's gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 have to happen then\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll tell you what's gonna have to\cb1 \
\cb3 happen you ready\cb1 \
\cb3 black mothers like you are going to have\cb1 \
\cb3 to start talking to black mothers\cb1 \
\cb3 of black daughters and start fixing that\cb1 \
\
\cb3 black women like you are going to have\cb1 \
\cb3 to start getting making an understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 that fathers need to be in these houses\cb1 \
\cb3 because if not you start getting the\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters\cb1 \
\cb3 that are produced with no supervision\cb1 \
\cb3 because you know good and well\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't go to a black woman and say\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing to her about her daughter she\cb1 \
\cb3 ready to fight you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's true that's true so i'm not so\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying it to be hurtful\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm saying it too is to let women\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 when you talk about men and women it's\cb1 \
\cb3 easy but when you got a son\cb1 \
\cb3 or a brother it's like well wait a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute\cb1 \
\cb3 they shouldn't survive the the the\cb1 \
\cb3 madness of being a black man in this\cb1 \
\cb3 country to only deal with a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 off the rip ain't gonna be cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and ain't gonna even try to be fit for\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i don't want to see that type\cb1 \
\cb3 of daughter-in-law exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 and then what about the other one you\cb1 \
\cb3 know because single was the only other\cb1 \
\cb3 comportion\cb1 \
\cb3 and then you know i'm not going to even\cb1 \
\cb3 start throwing the subject but you do\cb1 \
\cb3 know most of the kids here are born out\cb1 \
\cb3 of wedlock so\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that's also a factor too the\cb1 \
\cb3 older you get\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's why i did this subject not to\cb1 \
\cb3 trigger but just to get women like\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself to\cb1 \
\cb3 to think about it and you came in like\cb1 \
\cb3 no they should stay but now you're like\cb1 \
\cb3 well damn\cb1 \
\cb3 see well you know i i have a son and a\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter to raise\cb1 \
\cb3 and i want to get the best\cb1 \
\cb3 matches for them but i honestly called\cb1 \
\cb3 in\cb1 \
\cb3 to talk about me but\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i do need to think about what's\cb1 \
\cb3 going on how is your daughter\cb1 \
\cb3 with my children i have a i have a\cb1 \
\cb3 seven-year-old daughter and\cb1 \
\cb3 a nine-year-old son where's your where's\cb1 \
\cb3 your where's the father\cb1 \
\cb3 uh my my husband is deceased he\cb1 \
\cb3 he died at 39. okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 uh a solid male role model because\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters need fathers\cb1 \
\cb3 and sons needs to be phil but i've been\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been watching your show\cb1 \
\cb3 for a minute and i'm feeling like\cb1 \
\cb3 it's i'm it's over for me um\cb1 \
\cb3 and see and see that's the thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 this that's a different show\cb1 \
\cb3 but no but there's\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a solution for single mothers\cb1 \
\cb3 that don't that don't necessarily exist\cb1 \
\cb3 for\cb1 \
\cb3 others there's a solution for that too\cb1 \
\cb3 but i don't want to get i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 get derailed on that tonight\cb1 \
\cb3 but main thing is poor resources into\cb1 \
\cb3 your son\cb1 \
\cb3 because guess what the community is\cb1 \
\cb3 built by men\cb1 \
\cb3 and right now we're not producing the we\cb1 \
\cb3 need to produce more competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 man well you know i'm i'm in georgia and\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been thinking about\cb1 \
\cb3 sending my son to a military school\cb1 \
\cb3 just to help him to get the the type of\cb1 \
\cb3 guidance that he needs that i know that\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't really give him\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say that's a good idea i would\cb1 \
\cb3 say you would\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah wow all right now i'm gonna let you\cb1 \
\cb3 go i got some more people coming in\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it\cb1 \

\cb3 okay so you're right i'm not gonna be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to make this one anymore i feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been trying to argue that you know\cb1 \
\cb3 black men\cb1 \
\cb3 and black women but i feel like sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all are out here making us look\cb1 \
\cb3 bad well i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want see here's what i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want i don't want to take hope\cb1 \
\cb3 but i do want to raise awareness and\cb1 \
\cb3 in order to raise awareness sometimes it\cb1 \
\cb3 has to sting a little bit\cb1 \
\cb3 right because you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a you have children right one\cb1 \
\cb3 yes\cb1 \
\cb3 is it a boy or girl a girl okay\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you have a brother oh that's right\cb1 \
\cb3 your brother married out\cb1 \
\cb3 yes okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 um maybe i'll do a show follow up\cb1 \
\cb3 how we could address this and how we\cb1 \
\cb3 could fix it because like i said i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to take all hope um\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm glad you can kind of start to\cb1 \
\cb3 see where men are coming from in this\cb1 \
\cb3 position\cb1 \
\cb3 i can um i don't know if you saw um\cb1 \
\cb3 today earlier on the reel uh jeannie mai\cb1 \
\cb3 who is dating jeezy i know you say you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't deal with uh\cb1 \
\cb3 the rappers and stuff no but the real is\cb1 \
\cb3 in my kind of sector so what happened\cb1 \
\cb3 so they were talking about being\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 uh-oh\cb1 \
\cb3 say that again yes she was oh here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 and um the other\cb1 \
\cb3 new the new the new woman she's black as\cb1 \
\cb3 well okay and adrian\cb1 \
\cb3 um garcelle something\cb1 \
\cb3 so when jeannie said that she's four she\cb1 \
\cb3 thinks that women should be submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 to men\cb1 \
\cb3 and that um she she's okay with going\cb1 \
\cb3 out into the world\cb1 \
\cb3 working and leading in her life and then\cb1 \
\cb3 coming home and\cb1 \
\cb3 being submissive to her partner oh jesus\cb1 \
\cb3 christ\cb1 \
\cb3 the ladies on the rail did not agree\cb1 \
\cb3 they did not necessarily they did not\cb1 \
\cb3 agree at all they just felt like it\cb1 \
\cb3 should be equal\cb1 \
\cb3 it should be equal everything and\cb1 \
\cb3 um it shouldn't it shouldn't not well\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess in a world where we're talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about um\cb1 \
\cb3 a high-valued man and him like\cb1 \
\cb3 supporting you\cb1 \
\cb3 and paying your bills i don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a realistic thing to ask for\cb1 \
\cb3 things to be equal\cb1 \
\cb3 is he going to respect you yeah that's i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean that's giving if you're in a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 but equal no it's not going to be equal\cb1 \
\cb3 if he's working i'm going to check this\cb1 \
\cb3 out because that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 i see what you're talking about uh i\cb1 \
\cb3 need to do a little bit more work on\cb1 \
\cb3 that one\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but did you have anything you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 add on to the topic because i have\cb1 \
\cb3 three more people before we cycle on out\cb1 \

\cb3 should competitive high value or\cb1 \
\cb3 successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out i believe they can\cb1 \
\cb3 ah no i know they can i'm asking should\cb1 \
\cb3 they\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's not a matter of shoot because\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't really tell somebody that they\cb1 \
\cb3 have to do something it's all about the\cb1 \
\cb3 will and it's all about the attraction\cb1 \
\cb3 that you have for somebody else\cb1 \
\cb3 you know why i'm asking whether or not\cb1 \
\cb3 they should i get that i get that i only\cb1 \
\cb3 can control me\cb1 \
\cb3 but the way you're framing the question\cb1 \
\cb3 it it\cb1 \
\cb3 the way i'm where you're framing it it's\cb1 \
\cb3 it's\cb1 \
\cb3 like uh well you can you can exercise\cb1 \
\cb3 the option if you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 um if they don't what's the option\cb1 \
\cb3 if they don't marry out do they have\cb1 \
\cb3 okay how about this do competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful high-value black men\cb1 \
\cb3 have equal amount of black\cb1 \
\cb3 female options as non-black female\cb1 \
\cb3 options yes they do\cb1 \
\cb3 oh they do so you're saying the numbers\cb1 \
\cb3 are the same\cb1 \
\cb3 really yes they do in that can\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead i gotta hear this okay\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm new to this channel so um bear with\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 but i want to say this i feel i know\cb1 \
\cb3 that the media\cb1 \
\cb3 portrays numbers in such a propagandic\cb1 \
\cb3 way\cb1 \
\cb3 that we're not doing at all well you\cb1 \
\cb3 know what i don't use\cb1 \
\cb3 media i use blackdemographics.com black\cb1 \
\cb3 statistics\cb1 \
\cb3 for black people by black people taken\cb1 \
\cb3 by black people analyzed by black people\cb1 \
\cb3 right so i just want to say that yes\cb1 \
\cb3 they do\cb1 \
\cb3 have they do have options to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 the black woman i am from africa okay\cb1 \
\cb3 continent is filled with so many people\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but but ma'am we're in the united\cb1 \
\cb3 states so i mean i\cb1 \
\cb3 do respect i don't really want to try to\cb1 \
\cb3 play the globe\cb1 \
\cb3 uh pan-africa thing people are here\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about people who\cb1 \
\cb3 can't afford to go to continent to go\cb1 \
\cb3 dating\cb1 \
\cb3 here you're trying to say that black men\cb1 \
\cb3 who are successful competitive or high\cb1 \
\cb3 value have\cb1 \
\cb3 a a plethora of black women to choose\cb1 \
\cb3 from\cb1 \
\cb3 they do okay then what would you say to\cb1 \
\cb3 all of the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 on this show tonight who say completely\cb1 \
\cb3 different\cb1 \
\cb3 well not only did they say they didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 they have sons\cb1 \
\cb3 and they have brothers who have\cb1 \
\cb3 had to do this because they can't find\cb1 \
\cb3 what you were saying is in ready supply\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i would tell them this you have\cb1 \
\cb3 one of your videos where you talked\cb1 \
\cb3 about being in the right place\cb1 \
\cb3 you have also talked about working on\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself to make yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 accessible to that type of man that you\cb1 \
\cb3 are looking for\cb1 \
\cb3 you work on yourself you put your best\cb1 \
\cb3 self out there\cb1 \
\cb3 you work on your physical you work on\cb1 \
\cb3 your attitude as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and you will get to that person or you\cb1 \
\cb3 will get no no\cb1 \
\cb3 see i understand what i've told women to\cb1 \
\cb3 do\cb1 \
\cb3 right but we got to start with the okay\cb1 \
\cb3 let's\cb1 \
\cb3 let's start here okay\cb1 \
\cb3 men want basically three things for\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperation fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 and single yes\cb1 \
\cb3 are black women in general thought to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 they are perceived as not being called\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not okay ma'am i'm not i can't do\cb1 \
\cb3 the perceived thing because\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're doing ma'am is not being you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 okay answer your question well i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 let's be reasonable okay because it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not perception\cb1 \
\cb3 you got i don't need no man i'm a strong\cb1 \
\cb3 independent black woman black women\cb1 \
\cb3 play the sapphire thing up and it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 a media\cb1 \
\cb3 construction if and if you said is\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to say that all i have to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is walk out on the streets of new york\cb1 \
\cb3 city philadelphia atlanta\cb1 \
\cb3 with a camera and i can show you in any\cb1 \
\cb3 given day\cb1 \
\cb3 right okay so if they're in general\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not perceived as being\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 that's one thing that men want that\cb1 \
\cb3 black women in general\cb1 \
\cb3 are not known for what about fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 they are not known for that either um\cb1 \
\cb3 may i make a point\cb1 \
\cb3 okay after i make my point so okay two\cb1 \
\cb3 of the three\cb1 \
\cb3 two of the three things right they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 right so where's the were these large\cb1 \
\cb3 numbers of available\cb1 \
\cb3 women okay\cb1 \
\cb3 is it my turn now if you answer me you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't but you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 the math doesn't add up man you're just\cb1 \
\cb3 telling me that there are a lot of women\cb1 \
\cb3 out there\cb1 \
\cb3 you just got to go to the right places\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 two of the three things that men want\cb1 \
\cb3 don't exist and you just want to act\cb1 \
\cb3 like that didn't happen\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not really acting like it didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 happen\cb1 \
\cb3 i just want to point out that there are\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 like myself and like some other women\cb1 \
\cb3 that i know black women\cb1 \
\cb3 that are into being fit that are\cb1 \
\cb3 incorporated that are into being\cb1 \
\cb3 submissively man\cb1 \
\cb3 and maybe those numbers are not adding\cb1 \
\cb3 up to the statistics that you see that's\cb1 \
\cb3 just what i want to point out that you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to go back to the anecdotal with\cb1 \
\cb3 you and the people you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i get it but that does not work for the\cb1 \
\cb3 for the population\cb1 \
\cb3 the whole population i get it and i get\cb1 \
\cb3 it so how do you\cb1 \
\cb3 i am 36. where's your husband\cb1 \
\cb3 i am single where's your fiance\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not engaged at all my fiance passed\cb1 \
\cb3 away okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so why aren't you married because he\cb1 \
\cb3 passed away last year\cb1 \
\cb3 i already hear that that's all right but\cb1 \
\cb3 you get what i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 i do i know you see\cb1 \
\cb3 what i gather is many women who come\cb1 \
\cb3 this conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 no disrespect are rather innumerate not\cb1 \
\cb3 really versed on the numbers\cb1 \
\cb3 and then so quick to throw numbers out\cb1 \
\cb3 as being\cb1 \
\cb3 white supremacy or media con construct\cb1 \
\cb3 constructed propaganda and that's simply\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 true right you can go out and see with\cb1 \
\cb3 your own\cb1 \
\cb3 eyes are you familiar with spelman\cb1 \
\cb3 college\cb1 \
\cb3 black college i am huh\cb1 \
\cb3 i am okay spelman college all-female\cb1 \
\cb3 college black college\cb1 \
\cb3 scrapped their entire athletics\cb1 \
\cb3 department and to take all that money\cb1 \
\cb3 to put it into student body health for\cb1 \
\cb3 women because\cb1 \
\cb3 the chancellor the the president of the\cb1 \
\cb3 school realized that\cb1 \
\cb3 young black women were coming to college\cb1 \
\cb3 at 18 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 overweight and obese\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am we cannot act like there's a\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're saying is true that they're\cb1 \
\cb3 just a\cb1 \
\cb3 plethora of fit cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and single black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and i agree with you there is that\cb1 \
\cb3 population as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and it is the vast majority of the\cb1 \
\cb3 percentage\cb1 \
\cb3 of the black women and like\cb1 \
\cb3 you asked me what would i say to them\cb1 \
\cb3 would be\cb1 \
\cb3 to take accountability well i\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for saying that but before you\cb1 \
\cb3 can do that you have to agree with what\cb1 \
\cb3 i said because you came on and said\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm wrong you said there are plenty of\cb1 \
\cb3 women and then\cb1 \
\cb3 five minutes later you're saying they're\cb1 \
\cb3 not enough and they need to take\cb1 \
\cb3 accountability\cb1 \
\cb3 so that i don't see how you square that\cb1 \
\cb3 circle\cb1 \
\cb3 what i we need from women like yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 is to\cb1 \
\cb3 to understand the reality that men are\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 and whether you like it or not just\cb1 \
\cb3 accept that men\cb1 \
\cb3 are not going to accept women who are\cb1 \
\cb3 not cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and not fit and without black families\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't have black nothing and black\cb1 \
\cb3 men aren't going to accept it\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead um do you align cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 with being submissive no i don't even\cb1 \
\cb3 talking submissive yet\cb1 \
\cb3 but cooperation just means you're easy\cb1 \
\cb3 to get along with\cb1 \
\cb3 and and you know submissive is something\cb1 \
\cb3 completely different submissive is a\cb1 \
\cb3 whole another character conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 but thank you for getting on man i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit late appreciate you\cb1 \
\cb3 no problem thank you thank you very much\cb1 \
\cb3 yes\cb1 \
\cb3 see i've learned how to get around that\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive thing\cb1 \
\cb3 um mia\cb1 \
\cb3 me oh my gosh shop like a gyro hello\cb1 \
\cb3 so should competitive successful or high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out i definitely\cb1 \
\cb3 think they should because um\cb1 \
\cb3 the people that are around you that are\cb1 \
\cb3 in proximity to you matter\cb1 \
\cb3 um you you definitely reference a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 different data points\cb1 \
\cb3 that support and justify the notion that\cb1 \
\cb3 they should date out\cb1 \
\cb3 um however i guess\cb1 \
\cb3 some women that missed their mark if\cb1 \
\cb3 they tried to date men\cb1 \
\cb3 that were like the concentration of i\cb1 \
\cb3 guess high value man or\cb1 \
\cb3 henry's or hit squad man\cb1 \
\cb3 if the concentration of those men are\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess high um sometimes and then and\cb1 \
\cb3 then also when you don't grow up with a\cb1 \
\cb3 father\cb1 \
\cb3 or someone to help you vet then there\cb1 \
\cb3 also is a factor that can go\cb1 \
\cb3 against you like your family and your\cb1 \
\cb3 background\cb1 \
\cb3 so me in my case i don't you know\cb1 \
\cb3 have children or you know things like\cb1 \
\cb3 that i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 i know what i need to work on i know\cb1 \
\cb3 where i rank okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 however um i would say like when i was\cb1 \
\cb3 21\cb1 \
\cb3 i dated you know i thought i dated\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty well to do brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 um that i felt that were going places i\cb1 \
\cb3 really\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't want to date older but i realized\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 that probably was a solution that i had\cb1 \
\cb3 to go to\cb1 \
\cb3 because of the men that were in\cb1 \
\cb3 proximity to me\cb1 \
\cb3 the people who i was exposed to so\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i experienced some younger men\cb1 \
\cb3 that wasted my time\cb1 \
\cb3 um and and i really didn't understand i\cb1 \
\cb3 guess\cb1 \
\cb3 what mayor wanted i guess because i was\cb1 \
\cb3 really\cb1 \
\cb3 into fitness and um the fbi\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i was really into that however\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the men that were in proximity\cb1 \
\cb3 to me\cb1 \
\cb3 they do value thick\cb1 \
\cb3 women like the more ratchet like i see a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot of ratchet\cb1 \
\cb3 women honestly like i see a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 ratchet women\cb1 \
\cb3 um but that's not what so if that's not\cb1 \
\cb3 if that's not what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 well proximity does matter i think\cb1 \
\cb3 more i think something that matters more\cb1 \
\cb3 than anything else is just\cb1 \
\cb3 awareness we have gotten so far to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point\cb1 \
\cb3 where we it has been become so skewed\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 thick and fine and edited all this other\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff to where women\cb1 \
\cb3 uh honestly cannot be allowed to kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 go astray which we got to kind of pull\cb1 \
\cb3 this thing back on track and say it is\cb1 \
\cb3 important\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the thing it's not just about\cb1 \
\cb3 being rich\cb1 \
\cb3 or high value i'm talking about men who\cb1 \
\cb3 are just above average earners\cb1 \
\cb3 right you know regular blue collar guys\cb1 \
\cb3 white collar guys we're not asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 masters of universe\cb1 \
\cb3 and that and when i say that\cb1 \
\cb3 they just want women who are fit and and\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative that's that's that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a new thing to hear for a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 women so\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's you know important for\cb1 \
\cb3 women to hear this\cb1 \
\cb3 because i would tell you this most men\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 black men in mass would prefer to be\cb1 \
\cb3 with black women see that's what i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get lost that they\cb1 \
\cb3 you know like uh the guy who came on\cb1 \
\cb3 earlier to talk to his sister he came to\cb1 \
\cb3 her kind of like\cb1 \
\cb3 messed up about it because brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 would prefer to be with sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 i i gotta get on to the next call look\cb1 \
\cb3 we're getting getting late sis\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it\cb1 \
\cb3 all right no problem yeah i want to get\cb1 \
\cb3 clear ladies that i'm not saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 hey you need to be successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive married brothers want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 with sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 but are you giving them what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 you got to give men what they want just\cb1 \
\cb3 like men got to give women what they\cb1 \
\cb3 want\cb1 \
\cb3 uh unmute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 2 2 9 whatever this is\cb1 \
\cb3 uh mute yourself hello\cb1 \
\cb3 first name\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you need to mute the youtube channel\cb1 \
\cb3 in the background\cb1 \
\cb3 you're drunk\cb1 \
\cb3 or successful competitive men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 well yes i i believe so of course um\cb1 \
\cb3 and then again the lady that called\cb1 \
\cb3 before her just got off the phone\cb1 \
\cb3 i was like like men\cb1 \
\cb3 black men need to stay with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that was my point of it\cb1 \
\cb3 they need to stay with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i think black people you still have\cb1 \
\cb3 youtube playing in the background\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you got to turn it off i got to go\cb1 \
\cb3 into the next call cause it's it's\cb1 \
\cb3 give me five wait i got something to\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you is very important but no you\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta turn that off\cb1 \
\cb3 oh well this lady you know this thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just oh well me now\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm told you gotta turn out\cb1 \
\cb3 301\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 right your first name tiffany\cb1 \
\cb3 should successful competitive or high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out that's the question on the\cb1 \
\cb3 table you got\cb1 \
\cb3 now is this um generally speaking like\cb1 \
\cb3 all men or is it just black men\cb1 \
\cb3 well black men is where the subject\cb1 \
\cb3 matter is so\cb1 \
\cb3 stick with black men go ahead um i think\cb1 \
\cb3 they should but equally i think\cb1 \
\cb3 black women who are high value as well\cb1 \
\cb3 should date out\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right um why did you feel the\cb1 \
\cb3 need to inject that part\cb1 \
\cb3 well because it's like if high value\cb1 \
\cb3 black men are going to date out\cb1 \
\cb3 then what's left for high value black\cb1 \
\cb3 women well\cb1 \
\cb3 let me stop you let me stop you right\cb1 \
\cb3 let me answer the question first of\cb1 \
\cb3 those two things those two things aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 equal\cb1 \
\cb3 because last night i had a show it says\cb1 \
\cb3 do women really have the options they\cb1 \
\cb3 think they have\cb1 \
\cb3 and most women feel like they're high\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would tell you this most women who\cb1 \
\cb3 think they're high value are not\cb1 \
\cb3 and even if they are they don't have the\cb1 \
\cb3 options they believe they have\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's not a one-to-one relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not like you have ten high-value\cb1 \
\cb3 black\cb1 \
\cb3 men 10 high-value uh black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and 10 high-value black men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 and 10 high-value\cb1 \
\cb3 black women marry out that's not the\cb1 \
\cb3 numbers it doesn't work that way\cb1 \
\cb3 well i think that's a matter of opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 no it's not a matter of opinion it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact\cb1 \
\cb3 the numbers say it is\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean again i think it's a matter of\cb1 \
\cb3 opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 and if black high value men want to date\cb1 \
\cb3 out\cb1 \
\cb3 want to marry out it's marrying him\cb1 \
\cb3 marrying out\cb1 \
\cb3 if they want to marry out if they want\cb1 \
\cb3 to marry out then they\cb1 \
\cb3 should they they should do whatever they\cb1 \
\cb3 feel whatever makes them happy\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but you wanted to bring in you\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to bring in the women part though\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what you want to do\cb1 \
\cb3 why because well the thing is but when\cb1 \
\cb3 they think but hold on but you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't have the conversation but you\cb1 \
\cb3 seem to believe that\cb1 \
\cb3 a black woman who what makes a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman high value in your opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 um her background her level of education\cb1 \
\cb3 her health her mentally and physically\cb1 \
\cb3 i think that's what makes a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 women um\cb1 \
\cb3 i am that's all i am i'm educated\cb1 \
\cb3 that's all i like again that's all i\cb1 \
\cb3 like i am five i am five four\cb1 \
\cb3 dress size say that\cb1 \
\cb3 your dress size my dress size i wear a\cb1 \
\cb3 size 6.\cb1 \
\cb3 okay how much did you weigh the last\cb1 \
\cb3 time you weighed yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 i weigh 135. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 uh do most black so do what percentage\cb1 \
\cb3 of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 uh way what you weigh or less\cb1 \
\cb3 well i would have to check that but i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have that data in front just guess\cb1 \
\cb3 out of 100 like at least out of 100\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say probably um\cb1 \
\cb3 30 to 40 percent we come in different\cb1 \
\cb3 shapes and sizes no\cb1 \
\cb3 less than 20 percent 80 percent okay\cb1 \
\cb3 80 80 of black women are overweight and\cb1 \
\cb3 obese and there's one thing that is no\cb1 \
\cb3 the higher up\cb1 \
\cb3 women go in education and income the\cb1 \
\cb3 weight\cb1 \
\cb3 tends to increase as well well do you\cb1 \
\cb3 include the percentage of obesity\cb1 \
\cb3 amongst white women\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care we're not we're only\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about black no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on hold on ma'am i'm taking\cb1 \
\cb3 the conversation is you you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 shift it to white women when it suits\cb1 \
\cb3 you see if you want to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value black women\cb1 \
\cb3 have options to marry out then i need to\cb1 \
\cb3 then where are they high about where are\cb1 \
\cb3 these high value black women's\cb1 \
\cb3 weddings because there are lots of\cb1 \
\cb3 channels talking about they're just your\cb1 \
\cb3 mating and dating\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't see any of these women\cb1 \
\cb3 with men\cb1 \
\cb3 well may i speak yes\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's very aggressive just to\cb1 \
\cb3 isolate black women\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't see what you're not going to do\cb1 \
\cb3 this thing aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't play these word games man it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 man's talk show i've allowed you to\cb1 \
\cb3 speak\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not going to use the shaming\cb1 \
\cb3 language here ma'am i speak in facts\cb1 \
\cb3 not shaming i think i think it's very\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 and black women no it's not a thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know where you think that works\cb1 \
\cb3 but let's try this again like i said\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not going to overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 so if you want to have the conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 you can have the conversation but i will\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressively mute you if you try to\cb1 \
\cb3 overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 are we clear\cb1 \
\cb3 did you hear what i did i didn't i just\cb1 \
\cb3 said\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want me i'm saying i'm running\cb1 \
\cb3 a talk show man and when i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 and talking it's bad for the viewers\cb1 \
\cb3 so respect when i start speaking it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not like having a conversation in person\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm running a show\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's not being aggressive see that\cb1 \
\cb3 that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 anyway i don't want to go down that path\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 how old are you i'm actually\cb1 \
\cb3 27 27 what's your husband's name\cb1 \
\cb3 my husband i'm not married yet but i do\cb1 \
\cb3 i am in a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how long have you guys been engaged\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 for like three months now\cb1 \
\cb3 three months congratulations yeah what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you propose to you thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 when did he propose well we were\cb1 \
\cb3 actually at a\cb1 \
\cb3 we were actually at a family gathering\cb1 \
\cb3 when he did it\cb1 \
\cb3 so you know it's kind of like coded\cb1 \
\cb3 so he can't do it so what are you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 planning on when is the wedding date\cb1 \
\cb3 well we're trying to shoot for next year\cb1 \
\cb3 but it\cb1 \
\cb3 all depends on the whole covet thing but\cb1 \
\cb3 he's actually\cb1 \
\cb3 not american okay and what does it what\cb1 \
\cb3 does your husband do\cb1 \
\cb3 your fiance my husband is an engineer\cb1 \
\cb3 your fiance is an engineer yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 and what do you do what do i do i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 actually i work\cb1 \
\cb3 at nih um so i'm in a medical field\cb1 \
\cb3 so if we believe everything you say what\cb1 \
\cb3 percentage of black women have the same\cb1 \
\cb3 experience that you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot i just don't think a lot of this\cb1 \
\cb3 no ma'am you can't just\cb1 \
\cb3 no no see what no now see we were doing\cb1 \
\cb3 so well\cb1 \
\cb3 until you came out with this a lot but\cb1 \
\cb3 it's just not publicized\cb1 \
\cb3 yes there's a secret underground\cb1 \
\cb3 movement\cb1 \
\cb3 to keep high-value black women who are\cb1 \
\cb3 successfully marrying out\cb1 \
\cb3 a closely guarded state secret\cb1 \
\cb3 it is getting up get\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah it's a closer garden state secret\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta keep them apart god damn oh\cb1 \
\cb3 you just can't make this up man\cb1 \
\cb3 can't\cb1 \
\cb3 make it up can i make it up can i make\cb1 \

\cb3 even try to go down the path and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 still gonna get some irrational delusion\cb1 \
\cb3 good luck with that closely guarded\cb1 \
\cb3 state secret\cb1 \

\cb3 and telecommunications until that\cb1 \
\cb3 industry fell apart\cb1 \
\cb3 i.e worldcom all the telecommunications\cb1 \
\cb3 blah blah blah blah blah\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's a little bit in office products\cb1 \
\cb3 and then in advertising\cb1 \
\cb3 why is all that important well because\cb1 \
\cb3 i've in these streets is where i made my\cb1 \
\cb3 bones here in manhattan\cb1 \
\cb3 a little guy from oklahoma via dallas\cb1 \
\cb3 came up here and kicked people's ass\cb1 \
\cb3 why does that mean why does that matter\cb1 \
\cb3 because i think it matters\cb1 \
\cb3 when you know who you're talking to and\cb1 \
\cb3 i will tell you that when i came to new\cb1 \
\cb3 york city is when i first\cb1 \
\cb3 saw real success i mean i saw success\cb1 \
\cb3 you know in dallas and houston don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 me wrong but when i came to\cb1 \
\cb3 manhattan is when i saw that a million\cb1 \
\cb3 dollars was just getting started\cb1 \
\cb3 you know when oklahoma when you know\cb1 \
\cb3 back then if you was making 50 000 you\cb1 \
\cb3 were rich\cb1 \
\cb3 here that was a paycheck\cb1 \
\cb3 for some people why is that important\cb1 \
\cb3 because tonight's subject is going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 appointed discussion\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get right into it let's get right\cb1 \
\cb3 into it should high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men marry out should high value or\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 and ladies i'm gonna throw you in there\cb1 \
\cb3 too but why am i talking to the high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men tonight because i need you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies to understand these are the men\cb1 \
\cb3 you want\cb1 \
\cb3 see we can talk about the dusty's the\cb1 \
\cb3 crusties the beta male coons and all\cb1 \
\cb3 that other\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the men you want and my\cb1 \
\cb3 question is this\cb1 \
\cb3 should they should they marry out now\cb1 \
\cb3 funny i've heard this being kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 discussed a little bit on other\cb1 \
\cb3 platforms\cb1 \
\cb3 to a lesser degree talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody and most of what i've heard is\cb1 \
\cb3 even in the chat room is that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 saw it coming up\cb1 \
\cb3 people were more or less saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 you should not even if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high value\cb1 \
\cb3 you should still wait\cb1 \
\cb3 and marry within your group or the race\cb1 \
\cb3 and my question is this\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have done what it takes to be\cb1 \
\cb3 make yourself high value\cb1 \
\cb3 or if you are competitive and let's\cb1 \
\cb3 define competitive i consider a\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive man\cb1 \
\cb3 in the top 20 percent of men\cb1 \
\cb3 the top 20 percent of men that puts it\cb1 \
\cb3 around 70 000\cb1 \
\cb3 a year i consider that to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 financially competitive man\cb1 \
\cb3 top 20 to the top 15 20 that's 70 to 85\cb1 \
\cb3 000\cb1 \
\cb3 anything above that puts you in the in\cb1 \
\cb3 striking range of high value\cb1 \
\cb3 i consider you to be financially\cb1 \
\cb3 attractive if you're making seventy\cb1 \
\cb3 thousand dollars or more living in\cb1 \
\cb3 dallas houston austin san antonio\cb1 \
\cb3 where the cost of living buys a dollar\cb1 \
\cb3 will buy a dollar\cb1 \
\cb3 in new york city you need to adjust that\cb1 \
\cb3 up to about 150.\cb1 \
\cb3 in the bay area likewise so if you're a\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 who's financially attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a career of which you can\cb1 \
\cb3 explain\cb1 \
\cb3 in less than 20 seconds district manager\cb1 \
\cb3 for verizon or whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 or you own your own plumbing business\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever you have\cb1 \
\cb3 an income that's consistent\cb1 \
\cb3 you are in reasonable shape\cb1 \
\cb3 i consider you agree competitive and\cb1 \
\cb3 you're heterosexual i consider to be\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive anything on top of that is\cb1 \
\cb3 just a perk\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care how tall you are\cb1 \
\cb3 men like this tend to have been married\cb1 \
\cb3 the older they get or have children the\cb1 \
\cb3 older they get\cb1 \
\cb3 but we're talking about men across the\cb1 \
\cb3 board\cb1 \
\cb3 my hit squad guys my guys from 18 to 30\cb1 \
\cb3 can also fit into this group\cb1 \
\cb3 high earners in training or henry's in\cb1 \
\cb3 training high earners not rich yet in\cb1 \
\cb3 training hit squad\cb1 \
\cb3 henry's all these guys are henry's\cb1 \
\cb3 high or higher earners high earners not\cb1 \
\cb3 rich yet just a second\cb1 \
\cb3 why why is this important is that music\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to see if that music is loud\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it stopped\cb1 \
\cb3 oh why is all this important because\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get to the bottom of it ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the men that you want\cb1 \
\cb3 and a man does not have to be fine\cb1 \
\cb3 that's your job\cb1 \
\cb3 a man just has to be in shape fit for\cb1 \
\cb3 life an athlete for work\cb1 \
\cb3 and the question is a man that's\cb1 \
\cb3 actually done these things\cb1 \
\cb3 who's got himself an education a trade\cb1 \
\cb3 or a profession\cb1 \
\cb3 is earning more you know it's earning\cb1 \
\cb3 more than most people\cb1 \
\cb3 it's earning twice what a middle class\cb1 \
\cb3 family makes in this country the middle\cb1 \
\cb3 class family in this country makes\cb1 \
\cb3 around eighty\cb1 \
\cb3 two forty two thousand dollars a year so\cb1 \
\cb3 if a man is making\cb1 \
\cb3 twice what a middle class family makes\cb1 \
\cb3 i would consider him to be successful\cb1 \
\cb3 and successful makes you competitive and\cb1 \
\cb3 for the longest we've talked about\cb1 \
\cb3 the lack of competitive men the lack of\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive men that's why this whole\cb1 \
\cb3 high value thing came along and people\cb1 \
\cb3 just kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 thumb their nose at it because they talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about that they're no competitive me and\cb1 \
\cb3 much less high value\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 well that's the stats are in\cb1 \
\cb3 the facts are in the statistics are in\cb1 \
\cb3 and there are\cb1 \
\cb3 there are competitive men out here and\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men out here the question is\cb1 \
\cb3 if these men exist which they do\cb1 \
\cb3 should they marry out well the question\cb1 \
\cb3 is well why should they marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin glad you asked well\cb1 \
\cb3 one in four black women will marry in\cb1 \
\cb3 their lifetime and what i realized and\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've learned\cb1 \
\cb3 over months and months and months of\cb1 \
\cb3 talking to men\cb1 \
\cb3 and women that women have often ran\cb1 \
\cb3 across\cb1 \
\cb3 men in their in their youth\cb1 \
\cb3 that they have just bypassed waiting\cb1 \
\cb3 opting to stay on the train opting to\cb1 \
\cb3 enjoy their 20s not worried about\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 let's get right into it this is about\cb1 \
\cb3 black folk\cb1 \
\cb3 and if a black man is competitive and\cb1 \
\cb3 successful\cb1 \
\cb3 on his way to becoming high value\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely henry\cb1 \
\cb3 why should he wait\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking you ladies why should he wait\cb1 \
\cb3 for women\cb1 \
\cb3 from 18 to 27 who never\cb1 \
\cb3 really interested in marriage until you\cb1 \
\cb3 know later on in life\cb1 \
\cb3 when do a lot of women start getting\cb1 \
\cb3 interested in marriage\cb1 \

\cb3 settle down\cb1 \
\cb3 and choose him after you've been alpha\cb1 \
\cb3 widowed\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning you went out and had the alpha\cb1 \
\cb3 guy had your\cb1 \
\cb3 crazy sexual escapades and now you want\cb1 \

\cb3 competitive and they're ready to keep on\cb1 \
\cb3 moving with life\cb1 \
\cb3 and waiting to when waiting to marry and\cb1 \
\cb3 waiting to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 inside your race is wasting time that's\cb1 \
\cb3 what i hear from a lot of guys\cb1 \
\cb3 like well wait a minute kev i get myself\cb1 \
\cb3 together i do everything i'm supposed to\cb1 \

\cb3 in shape and of the and of the 20\cb1 \
\cb3 percent that are\cb1 \

\cb3 what am i supposed to do and even when\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm happen to find one that may be in my\cb1 \
\cb3 city\cb1 \
\cb3 our culture is such that we were raised\cb1 \
\cb3 to think of each other as independence\cb1 \
\cb3 not interdependent\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you get what are you telling\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys to do and then here comes\cb1 \
\cb3 becky\cb1 \
\cb3 marisol myleen anu and they are not only\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to get married they were raised\cb1 \
\cb3 to think of men as integral\cb1 \
\cb3 integral to life that they were raised\cb1 \
\cb3 to think of getting married and building\cb1 \
\cb3 with somebody in their youth\cb1 \
\cb3 so i gotta ask you the question ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 if your son was a high value or a\cb1 \
\cb3 successful man\cb1 \
\cb3 what should he do see you thought i was\cb1 \
\cb3 going to ask you what you think about me\cb1 \

\cb3 you have gone through the trouble of\cb1 \
\cb3 raising a successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high value son what are\cb1 \
\cb3 you going to tell him to do\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you going to tell him to do now\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 in the in the comment section um i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want it to get pejorative\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want to get insulting we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to have a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation men and women like\cb1 \
\cb3 grown-ups\cb1 \
\cb3 if i see you in here talking crazy about\cb1 \
\cb3 men i'm going to time you out\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll see you new talking crazy about the\cb1 \
\cb3 women i'm going to time you out\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yeah dude why are you in here to spam\cb1 \
\cb3 my chat room don't come in my chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 spam and stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 yes and in reality is this\cb1 \
\cb3 you know on my show you've heard me say\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel sorry for\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i've had people brothers in the\cb1 \
\cb3 comment section are we starting to see\cb1 \
\cb3 women open their eyes\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just one man you know and i will say\cb1 \
\cb3 i feel sorry for many women who\cb1 \
\cb3 many of our sisters who were lied to\cb1 \
\cb3 led astray but the fact of the matter is\cb1 \
\cb3 i see young men\cb1 \
\cb3 who are doing the work\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to continue to move forward life\cb1 \
\cb3 and i cannot in good conscience\cb1 \
\cb3 tell them that they need to spend the\cb1 \
\cb3 next 10 or 15 years\cb1 \
\cb3 just waiting well wait a minute kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 wait a minute kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 you're telling these guys that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should date out i'm saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking you what would you tell them\cb1 \
\cb3 here's one of the common objections well\cb1 \
\cb3 wait wait a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys normally say well they've\cb1 \
\cb3 dated this girl that they dated kim and\cb1 \
\cb3 keisha and tammy\cb1 \
\cb3 and tanisha and shannon and karen\cb1 \
\cb3 and and zoey and\cb1 \
\cb3 and amber well they but they haven't\cb1 \
\cb3 dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all black women that is one of the how\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the number one reason you've\cb1 \
\cb3 dated some black women but you haven't\cb1 \
\cb3 dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all black women brothers men how many\cb1 \
\cb3 times have you heard this\cb1 \
\cb3 you've dated some but you haven't dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all if you've heard this as a man\cb1 \
\cb3 raise your hand put a one in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room you've dated some black women but\cb1 \
\cb3 you haven't dated\cb1 \
\cb3 all put in one in the chat room if you\cb1 \
\cb3 heard that\cb1 \
\cb3 the sum not all i mean you've only dated\cb1 \
\cb3 some\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 brown becky whoo the lies uh look here\cb1 \
\cb3 chick\cb1 \
\cb3 you you need to know where you are\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to know where you are you call\cb1 \
\cb3 in my show if you like to\cb1 \
\cb3 but don't come over here talking crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't lie over here\cb1 \
\cb3 look at all these men saying they've\cb1 \
\cb3 heard this you've dated some but you\cb1 \
\cb3 haven't dated all\cb1 \
\cb3 and the thing is my question is this to\cb1 \
\cb3 the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 so black women who tell these guys to\cb1 \
\cb3 stand in racial solidarity\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i'm not taking the position i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 asking the questions\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking the women what should the men\cb1 \
\cb3 do what would you tell your son to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your blood brother\cb1 \
\cb3 to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell him to do you tell\cb1 \
\cb3 him to just stand there\cb1 \
\cb3 and and and you know to a competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful or high value man the most\cb1 \
\cb3 important asset is time\cb1 \
\cb3 the most important resource is time\cb1 \
\cb3 wasting time\cb1 \
\cb3 wasting time well you got to put in time\cb1 \
\cb3 and effort\cb1 \
\cb3 well marisol marlene becky and i knew\cb1 \
\cb3 are coming after him\cb1 \
\cb3 after uh keith and after marcus\cb1 \
\cb3 and after reggie i mean and after aaron\cb1 \
\cb3 and after greg\cb1 \
\cb3 these women aren't wasting time matter\cb1 \
\cb3 of fact dr t\cb1 \
\cb3 san johnson talks about how these women\cb1 \
\cb3 are enrolled in his class\cb1 \
\cb3 right now in college to learn how to be\cb1 \
\cb3 better girlfriends and wives for black\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 these women aren't are approaching\cb1 \
\cb3 they are actively competing for men\cb1 \
\cb3 so you want you telling your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 your son that he should take his active\cb1 \
\cb3 time\cb1 \
\cb3 to pursue a passive possible partner\cb1 \
\cb3 let me say that again you're telling\cb1 \
\cb3 your brother your loved blood brother\cb1 \
\cb3 or your biological son that he should\cb1 \
\cb3 take his time to pursue\cb1 \
\cb3 actively pursue a passive\cb1 \
\cb3 possible partner you want him to\cb1 \
\cb3 actively pursue somebody who's passive\cb1 \
\cb3 well he has to actively pursue these but\cb1 \
\cb3 these women are actively pursuing him\cb1 \
\cb3 how that's supposed to work okay\cb1 \
\cb3 scratch that he's out here already\cb1 \
\cb3 dating\cb1 \
\cb3 and he can't find we're all the good\cb1 \
\cb3 ones we're all the good women here\cb1 \
\cb3 where are they i've said it myself if\cb1 \
\cb3 you are a competitive or a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 woman it's\cb1 \
\cb3 only a fool hides value if you're out\cb1 \
\cb3 there why can't he find you\cb1 \
\cb3 because becky marisol mailing and i knew\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't having any problems\cb1 \
\cb3 finding one in three black men who have\cb1 \
\cb3 a college degree\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out they're not having a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 finding black men\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you if you consider yourself to\cb1 \
\cb3 be a competitive or a higher value woman\cb1 \
\cb3 having a problem finding them\cb1 \
\cb3 is it because you're sitting there\cb1 \
\cb3 waiting for god to do it\cb1 \
\cb3 you wait no jesus what is it\cb1 \
\cb3 or heather's learning fried chicken\cb1 \
\cb3 well you ain't dead at all black women\cb1 \
\cb3 so what is he supposed to do\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i get it he's supposed to move i get\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the men that are supposed to go\cb1 \
\cb3 be successful in his area then he's\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to move wherever he is\cb1 \
\cb3 and then go be go move where the women\cb1 \
\cb3 are and then\cb1 \
\cb3 go hunt the women\cb1 \
\cb3 well if he's doing all that\cb1 \
\cb3 what about the business\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is what you ladies need to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive men you must compete for\cb1 \
\cb3 these\cb1 \
\cb3 you must compete for these men you must\cb1 \
\cb3 compete with the women that are around\cb1 \
\cb3 him and women\cb1 \
\cb3 are drawn to power money and status\cb1 \
\cb3 if the man you want has power money and\cb1 \
\cb3 status\cb1 \
\cb3 you best believe there's going to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 group of women around him how\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive are you with those women\cb1 \
\cb3 and expecting him to pick solely on\cb1 \
\cb3 racial solidarity\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i think it's a pretty uh\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think that's a power position\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm willing to hear the argument\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your brother to do\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell your son to do well\cb1 \

\cb3 the women out here that are quote\cb1 \
\cb3 unquote on your level\cb1 \
\cb3 they're they they are not trying to even\cb1 \
\cb3 stay in shape for themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 they ain't even trying to stay fit for\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves i know you can't take her to\cb1 \
\cb3 the home builders association ball i\cb1 \
\cb3 know you can't take her to the you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 take her anywhere\cb1 \
\cb3 she got you know she can't wear\cb1 \
\cb3 something with her back out with all\cb1 \
\cb3 them rolls and carrying on\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean really what would you tell these\cb1 \
\cb3 men because these are the\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful men these are the\cb1 \
\cb3 guys on the way to being those high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 yet you should just pick a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 unfit not physically fit\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't even prize her appearance\cb1 \
\cb3 when you have fit women checking for you\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not purple it's blue\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling the guys that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should do\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling the guys they\cb1 \
\cb3 should do are you saying that look here\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 i i don't i know what i want i know\cb1 \
\cb3 that i raised you to love this\cb1 \
\cb3 man if you type in all caps if you keep\cb1 \
\cb3 typing in all caps you're going to get\cb1 \
\cb3 uh timed out\cb1 \
\cb3 uh victoria whitlock i already timed you\cb1 \
\cb3 out earlier today\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to slow your roll\cb1 \
\cb3 let me go ahead and help you cause i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not gonna i'm not gonna have you expand\cb1 \
\cb3 my chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 you've been on one for the last two\cb1 \
\cb3 hours you came over here two hours early\cb1 \
\cb3 to start typing to nobody\cb1 \
\cb3 not gonna happen the things we do for\cb1 \
\cb3 love what's your husband say stacey\cb1 \
\cb3 baldwin\cb1 \
\cb3 because uh if anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know my position is i think\cb1 \
\cb3 brothers love sisters more than sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 love brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 i think if black women could date out\cb1 \
\cb3 like black men can\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd be gone but the reality is most of\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 this is my personal opinion i personally\cb1 \
\cb3 think\cb1 \
\cb3 that if black women in mass have the\cb1 \
\cb3 same\cb1 \
\cb3 level of market attractiveness\cb1 \
\cb3 to to non-black people\cb1 \
\cb3 as black men have to non-black people\cb1 \
\cb3 if you had the options that the rank and\cb1 \
\cb3 fire brother had you would take them\cb1 \
\cb3 i think a lot of you feel like you stuck\cb1 \
\cb3 with black men because you can't get\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing else\cb1 \
\cb3 because look at how you show up for them\cb1 \
\cb3 i say\cb1 \
\cb3 women should i say women tell men what\cb1 \
\cb3 they think they deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 by their appearance and their attitude\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 if the average black woman today\cb1 \
\cb3 eighty percent of you are overweight\cb1 \
\cb3 you're telling\cb1 \
\cb3 black men you don't think they deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 much\cb1 \
\cb3 if black men have been saying they want\cb1 \
\cb3 just cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have woman after woman after\cb1 \
\cb3 woman saying yeah i know that\cb1 \
\cb3 but they're not getting it black men\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't getting it you're saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't deserve\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperation and deserve a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't care about her appearance\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that won't fly with anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 else\cb1 \
\cb3 and then when you say something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 what do so many black women say\cb1 \
\cb3 well somebody will have to somebody love\cb1 \
\cb3 her somebody will hit it\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody that's always to come back when\cb1 \
\cb3 you start saying something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 when you start saying something about it\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody will hit it somebody will hit\cb1 \
\cb3 it somebody hit it\cb1 \
\cb3 that's how low it sank but tonight we're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about it\cb1 \
\cb3 what should you tell them what would you\cb1 \
\cb3 tell your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 and tonight we're not worried about\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on with the women tonight\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm asking the women what you would tell\cb1 \
\cb3 the men\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling the men they should\cb1 \
\cb3 do what should they do ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm just communicating what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 hearing from my clients\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've heard from men over the last\cb1 \
\cb3 decades\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm asking you ladies what you would\cb1 \
\cb3 tell these men they should do\cb1 \
\cb3 actionable advice not\cb1 \
\cb3 just pray not just keep keep\cb1 \
\cb3 hope alive and you will find\cb1 \
\cb3 the uh one out of five\cb1 \
\cb3 black women that are in shape and\cb1 \
\cb3 pray to god that she is unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 no children sane\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean we're just talking about fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 if you find the one out of\cb1 \
\cb3 one out of five that's just in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 she's still got to be unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 no kids same\cb1 \
\cb3 we haven't even adjusted for looks yet\cb1 \
\cb3 that what are the numbers twenty million\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 eighty percent overweight tadama drops\cb1 \
\cb3 from twenty to four million\cb1 \
\cb3 four million total that's not even\cb1 \
\cb3 adjusted for age\cb1 \
\cb3 if you adjust for age from age 18 to 45\cb1 \
\cb3 you drop that number down to roughly\cb1 \
\cb3 about 1.6 million\cb1 \
\cb3 1.6 million that's not even adjusted for\cb1 \
\cb3 marital status\cb1 \
\cb3 23 20 26 or 32 percent marital rate\cb1 \
\cb3 was a 27 28 marital rate let's call it\cb1 \
\cb3 30\cb1 \
\cb3 1.6\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so for simple math you're talking around\cb1 \
\cb3 roughly eight hundred thousand\cb1 \
\cb3 let's give it a million black women that\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't my unmarried a million that are\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 and unmarried we still have enough in\cb1 \
\cb3 shape\cb1 \
\cb3 unmarried 18 to 45 a million\cb1 \
\cb3 plus or minus all right a million and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's across the united states\cb1 \
\cb3 then we still have to say unmarried in\cb1 \
\cb3 shape\cb1 \
\cb3 what percentage of those have kids\cb1 \
\cb3 then you can start going into the things\cb1 \
\cb3 like looks\cb1 \
\cb3 then you can start going into things\cb1 \
\cb3 like education\cb1 \
\cb3 uh income whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 you always talk about we're all the good\cb1 \
\cb3 men we're all the good women at\cb1 \
\cb3 the good fit women the good fit we're\cb1 \
\cb3 all the good women at and by good we\cb1 \
\cb3 mean fit and cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 we're all the good black women in fit\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 we're all the good black women that fit\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative we're all the good black\cb1 \
\cb3 women that fit\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative that's it so\cb1 \
\cb3 we it's all we talk about fit\cb1 \

\cb3 sit around and talk about how the study\cb1 \
\cb3 was done\cb1 \
\cb3 versus uh who's proposing to you\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you find a man\cb1 \
\cb3 that's all i want to hear from you i\cb1 \

\cb3 american institute i don't want to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 anything about the numbers i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to know why your big head ass\cb1 \
\cb3 can't find a man\cb1 \
\cb3 since you since you're supposed to be\cb1 \
\cb3 the and all\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i'm going there tonight so y'all\cb1 \
\cb3 might as well dig deep\cb1 \
\cb3 dig deep we're going there tonight why\cb1 \
\cb3 can't your big head ass find a man\cb1 \
\cb3 huh why not\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you find one you're the\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a phd you're a phd and right\cb1 \
\cb3 you're everything a man is supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 want more then why can't you find one\cb1 \
\cb3 but you sure gotta hmm right\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard some of the stupidest\cb1 \
\cb3 arguments but all i want to hear from\cb1 \
\cb3 these women making these arguments\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you find your man now don't\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about the collective\cb1 \
\cb3 and what's going on on the moon and out\cb1 \
\cb3 in the you know\cb1 \
\cb3 a delta quadrant you know what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on in the ninth\cb1 \
\cb3 you know around you know the the rings\cb1 \
\cb3 of saturn no\cb1 \
\cb3 why can't you seem to get your ball head\cb1 \
\cb3 ass man\cb1 \
\cb3 um because this is what men and black\cb1 \
\cb3 men have heard\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over and over and over again\cb1 \
\cb3 that either if you are out there\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful this your abusive cheater uh\cb1 \
\cb3 down low gay or you're dating out so oh\cb1 \
\cb3 well then why shouldn't they\cb1 \
\cb3 since since either they don't exist and\cb1 \
\cb3 when they do exist you find something\cb1 \
\cb3 wrong with them\cb1 \
\cb3 why should they stay what would you tell\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 how inviting does it brother says it\cb1 \
\cb3 seems like a civil war\cb1 \
\cb3 why why would you be a war with a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the war what's the war about i\cb1 \
\cb3 thought the war was there were no\cb1 \
\cb3 there were no men but now you're showing\cb1 \
\cb3 that men exist\cb1 \
\cb3 and then if you get one in four are\cb1 \
\cb3 marrying in their lifetime if one in\cb1 \
\cb3 four black women are marrying in their\cb1 \
\cb3 lifetime\cb1 \
\cb3 and we got a 51 percent divorce rate\cb1 \
\cb3 that's higher than that in the black\cb1 \
\cb3 community\cb1 \
\cb3 but i don't know the number so i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 take the low number if the number is\cb1 \
\cb3 still 51 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 if the number still holds\cb1 \
\cb3 why 8 out of 10 of those divorces being\cb1 \
\cb3 found by black women\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're the least married\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you defiling divorce at a rate\cb1 \
\cb3 four times higher than your men\cb1 \
\cb3 so even if a black man did stay around\cb1 \
\cb3 would a black woman stay with him\cb1 \
\cb3 how many times have you guys heard on my\cb1 \
\cb3 show how long were you with the guy i\cb1 \
\cb3 was with the guy for two years four\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 why didn't you get married well\cb1 \
\cb3 something happened\cb1 \
\cb3 uh who ended it i did\cb1 \
\cb3 i ended it how many times we hear this i\cb1 \
\cb3 ended it why oh i ended it i ended it\cb1 \
\cb3 and then you ended why did you end it\cb1 \
\cb3 especially the marriage and all of a\cb1 \
\cb3 sudden why'd you end it\cb1 \
\cb3 oh cause it got abusive all of a sudden\cb1 \
\cb3 all these men out here just\cb1 \
\cb3 black women all of a sudden we've had an\cb1 \
\cb3 epidemic of black men who get married to\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and they just apparently just whooping\cb1 \
\cb3 ass from coast to coast\cb1 \
\cb3 we had a woman coming in talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 she was married to a family law attorney\cb1 \
\cb3 in dallas and he was apparently whooping\cb1 \
\cb3 her tail i'm like whoa\cb1 \

\cb3 if you say abuse infidelity\cb1 \
\cb3 no one's supposed to question it i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 sorry i\cb1 \
\cb3 question it i don't trust most of what i\cb1 \
\cb3 hear from some of you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 from some of you ladies i don't believe\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \

\cb3 so we're going to get into it tonight\cb1 \
\cb3 we're talking about the kind and caliber\cb1 \
\cb3 of men that you say you want\cb1 \
\cb3 that definitely other women of other\cb1 \
\cb3 races want\cb1 \
\cb3 and they're sneaking over here they're\cb1 \
\cb3 tiptoeing over into enemy territory\cb1 \
\cb3 and doing like the invasion of their\cb1 \
\cb3 body snatches picking them up one at a\cb1 \

\cb3 guys what they should do\cb1 \

\cb3 let's get it\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \

\cb3 should do\cb1 \
\cb3 now i understand something i'll be nice\cb1 \
\cb3 to you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're nice to me but don't come in\cb1 \
\cb3 here acting crazy because\cb1 \
\cb3 men really want to know what you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 think they should do because\cb1 \
\cb3 it doesn't seem like many sisters want\cb1 \
\cb3 brothers to do much anything other than\cb1 \
\cb3 weight\cb1 \
\cb3 indefinitely hear women talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm getting myself in shape okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 how long should it take to get yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 hello i'll mute yourself please\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm good\cb1 \
\cb3 you got it um so\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess what i wanted to first i wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 to respond to the first thing you said\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 how long a black black men should wait\cb1 \
\cb3 on black women\cb1 \
\cb3 oh just a second i want to make sure\cb1 \
\cb3 that i'm off mute\cb1 \
\cb3 uh go do test test test test\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead go ahead okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so um yeah so yeah what i wanted to say\cb1 \
\cb3 is that\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i don't know i think black men\cb1 \
\cb3 need to\cb1 \
\cb3 start dating seriously when they're\cb1 \
\cb3 younger as opposed to waiting to their\cb1 \
\cb3 middle age\cb1 \
\cb3 ready to start a family and just okay\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on they should start dating\cb1 \
\cb3 cert in their youth staying seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 younger like the way asians do where\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the man and woman both dating\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously at younger ages\cb1 \
\cb3 um because i think that gives you more\cb1 \
\cb3 time to find somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 when they get you like out of college\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um i i know most people start doing\cb1 \
\cb3 they're out of\cb1 \
\cb3 training or most people start they start\cb1 \
\cb3 dating at 16 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm saying dating seriously like\cb1 \
\cb3 dating to mary if you know you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be married\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is most people start how\cb1 \
\cb3 old are you 22.\cb1 \
\cb3 all right you're a bit young for this so\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't know what you're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 let me tell you most people start dating\cb1 \
\cb3 the the\cb1 \
\cb3 national age is 16.\cb1 \
\cb3 most many people are already\cb1 \
\cb3 married by non-black folks are getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married between the ages of 21 and 25.\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly that's what i'm trying to say so\cb1 \
\cb3 i even i have a lot of older\cb1 \
\cb3 black male friends and a lot of them are\cb1 \
\cb3 where's your boyfriend\cb1 \
\cb3 i have a boyfriend yeah he's not here\cb1 \
\cb3 but i have a boyfriend how long you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 been together\cb1 \
\cb3 we've been together four months\cb1 \
\cb3 four months are you wanting to get\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay does he want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay and he's older so okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so you would tell black men they need to\cb1 \
\cb3 start dating younger\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning black men black men need to date\cb1 \
\cb3 younger who would they date though\cb1 \
\cb3 they'd date black women in college not\cb1 \
\cb3 just black women but\cb1 \
\cb3 they but they did black women in college\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't the one no you can't kimmy\cb1 \
\cb3 why not okay okay\cb1 \
\cb3 do you think these that i'm just making\cb1 \
\cb3 this up no i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 care apparently you don't understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that many\cb1 \
\cb3 many women your age aren't trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with guys\cb1 \
\cb3 your age because they're broke\cb1 \
\cb3 how does your boyfriend\cb1 \
\cb3 38\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for making my point i tried\cb1 \
\cb3 a guy your age i tried that and he\cb1 \
\cb3 wasted my time\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you mean he wasted your time\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 we so i dated this guy for a year and\cb1 \
\cb3 then he decided that\cb1 \
\cb3 he wanted to do his own thing okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 well here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not going to try to get into what\cb1 \
\cb3 went on with your relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 you're kind of young for this but here's\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing black men do want to date\cb1 \
\cb3 thing is women your age in general\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't trying to date younger guys\cb1 \
\cb3 because young guys are broke\cb1 \
\cb3 so you end up wanting older guys which\cb1 \
\cb3 is fine\cb1 \
\cb3 um as long as you're dating towards\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage and you're 38 years old you're\cb1 \
\cb3 out 22\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah has he met your parents\cb1 \
\cb3 uh not yet\cb1 \
\cb3 well wow\cb1 \
\cb3 i got all kinds of questions for this at\cb1 \
\cb3 38 and you're 22. so we're doing we're\cb1 \
\cb3 doing\cb1 \
\cb3 we're we're a little bit long distance\cb1 \
\cb3 currently but yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 he's almost 40 you're you're 22. he\cb1 \
\cb3 shouldn't be anywhere near you unless\cb1 \
\cb3 he's trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 but we're working on this it's not we\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't we ain't working on\cb1 \
\cb3 he's a 40 year old man you're 22. he\cb1 \
\cb3 should know\cb1 \
\cb3 have ring in pocket step into a 22 year\cb1 \
\cb3 old woman\cb1 \
\cb3 see you need to call back on another\cb1 \
\cb3 show because here's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 first up yes you need to start dating\cb1 \
\cb3 younger\cb1 \
\cb3 but black men can't date younger because\cb1 \
\cb3 they can't date black women because\cb1 \
\cb3 black women ain't trying to check for\cb1 \
\cb3 black men because they want\cb1 \
\cb3 me with money in the bag and all this\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of stuff and you don't have that\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're your age\cb1 \
\cb3 number one but number two let's shift\cb1 \
\cb3 gears where's your daddy at\cb1 \
\cb3 um you're not around can't be around you\cb1 \
\cb3 know he's gonna be around cannot be\cb1 \
\cb3 around cause you're dating a 40 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 dude\cb1 \
\cb3 problem number one did you this guy that\cb1 \
\cb3 you're dating did he step to you with\cb1 \
\cb3 the intention of marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yes did you make did you make\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage a requirement before you went\cb1 \
\cb3 out on a date with him\cb1 \
\cb3 um no but no you did not then then\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't then you cannot be sure where\cb1 \
\cb3 he's going\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i asked you about your\cb1 \
\cb3 parents\cb1 \
\cb3 because a man that 38 years old around\cb1 \
\cb3 28 year old\cb1 \
\cb3 22 year old young lady uh he shouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 be around you unless\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to get married and he\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't want to get married but if you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 but we we haven't even slept together\cb1 \
\cb3 yet so that's another thing i don't give\cb1 \
\cb3 a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously okay i don't care okay\cb1 \
\cb3 fall back watch the show he needs to be\cb1 \
\cb3 this man needs to be vetted\cb1 \
\cb3 he needs to be vetted by men and you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to fall back and watch some more\cb1 \
\cb3 show thank you sis\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah 22 year old women yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you had a problem with it bro you\cb1 \
\cb3 can call me\cb1 \
\cb3 if you got a problem with it bruh you\cb1 \
\cb3 can call me i'll take your call\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't i think that as a as a 38 year\cb1 \
\cb3 old man\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to be very clear on why you're\cb1 \
\cb3 missing dealing with a woman younger\cb1 \
\cb3 than you\cb1 \
\cb3 if it's just a physical thing and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 not looking to be married\cb1 \
\cb3 she's looking for a fun and and somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 a date older and they have new\cb1 \
\cb3 experiences that's fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't play with young women\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting to get married especially as a\cb1 \
\cb3 man that age\cb1 \
\cb3 you need your if you're playing\cb1 \
\cb3 games\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so let's get on to it\cb1 \
\cb3 karma hello\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm mute hey how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 very well how are you doing i'm good\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell me in that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should high value or success successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high value me and mary\cb1 \
\cb3 out\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 yes okay why\cb1 \
\cb3 because if they worked\cb1 \
\cb3 hard enough and long enough\cb1 \
\cb3 their purpose was to be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 get anything they want okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so whatever they want they can buy\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have sons three\cb1 \
\cb3 uh makes sense\cb1 \
\cb3 um now how does the youngest\cb1 \
\cb3 11 how does the oldest 21\cb1 \
\cb3 um would you prefer that they marry\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 absolutely um absolutely\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and the middle one is how old\cb1 \
\cb3 15. so the 21 year old what is he\cb1 \
\cb3 telling you dating is like for him\cb1 \
\cb3 with black women oh no\cb1 \
\cb3 okay here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 if you know what the experience oh i\cb1 \
\cb3 know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i just want you to see it it's it's it's\cb1 \
\cb3 invigorating because\cb1 \
\cb3 when he tells me about his dating\cb1 \
\cb3 choices\cb1 \
\cb3 i go back to what i\cb1 \
\cb3 instilled in him as a baby\cb1 \
\cb3 until where he is right now okay but\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 what he tells me is oh my god\cb1 \
\cb3 okay like he has a type and she is not\cb1 \
\cb3 black she is not brown as me\cb1 \
\cb3 she does not have the texture of hair\cb1 \
\cb3 as i do she is more of a\cb1 \
\cb3 mixed uh\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you say it like a long hair\cb1 \
\cb3 light skin yeah uh\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the things they talk about in\cb1 \
\cb3 america we kind of call that\cb1 \
\cb3 racially ambiguous but a lot of women\cb1 \
\cb3 who are latina\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of fit that prototype or a\cb1 \
\cb3 fair-skinned black woman but but the\cb1 \
\cb3 thing is\cb1 \
\cb3 what is why is he choosing these women\cb1 \
\cb3 because they bring\cb1 \
\cb3 he told me he said mom and i don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 into his business\cb1 \
\cb3 i just kind of listen to what he says\cb1 \
\cb3 and the pictures that he chooses to show\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 and so that's when i learned he had a\cb1 \
\cb3 type and what he says is that\cb1 \
\cb3 in our in our community which is\cb1 \
\cb3 predominantly\cb1 \
\cb3 black and\cb1 \
\cb3 the young girls that are his age\cb1 \
\cb3 are nasty\cb1 \
\cb3 and they are black and i'm sorry to say\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 nasty what do you mean nasty anywhere\cb1 \
\cb3 they look dirty they got a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 tattoos\cb1 \
\cb3 hair from weave and wigs\cb1 \
\cb3 cursing they don't cook\cb1 \
\cb3 um so do you know what happens so bad\cb1 \
\cb3 body type\cb1 \
\cb3 let me ask you some questions as the as\cb1 \
\cb3 the mother of three boys do you know any\cb1 \
\cb3 mothers of daughters\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have any friends who have\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters yes yes yes yes yes but what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you talk to\cb1 \
\cb3 the women about their daughters because\cb1 \
\cb3 their daughters should be\cb1 \
\cb3 being raised for you can't i can't\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't tell them anything they're\cb1 \
\cb3 getting tattoos\cb1 \
\cb3 i said uh hold on let me let me stop\cb1 \
\cb3 right here though because we have\cb1 \
\cb3 something you got three boys\cb1 \
\cb3 and your oldest is basically saying i\cb1 \
\cb3 see you mom\cb1 \
\cb3 but the women the black women are not\cb1 \
\cb3 like you\cb1 \
\cb3 they're they're you use the word nasty\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna say unappealing\cb1 \
\cb3 um okay uh and i want to pick\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to stick on the\cb1 \
\cb3 the uh attitudinal things the attitudes\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the the cursing the uh\cb1 \
\cb3 inability to cooperate not really want\cb1 \
\cb3 to cook or anything like that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh because the other ones can be\cb1 \
\cb3 easily mischaracterized as pejorative\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the\cb1 \
\cb3 the weave and all that i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 get down that path so you're telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 as a as a mother in a community you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't go to another brother and say sis\cb1 \
\cb3 i got three boys you got three girls let\cb1 \
\cb3 me tell you my sons\cb1 \
\cb3 are not dating women that look like your\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters and here's what they're saying\cb1 \
\cb3 and you know i would love to see our\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \

\cb3 but\cb1 \
\cb3 very much my blood um and i recently\cb1 \
\cb3 went to his wedding uh two months ago\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was an interracial wedding\cb1 \
\cb3 and um he started talking to me very\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 about wanting to be married i would say\cb1 \
\cb3 about eight years ago i was already\cb1 \
\cb3 married i've been married 11 years to my\cb1 \
\cb3 college sweetheart and\cb1 \
\cb3 we have three kids at home school so\cb1 \
\cb3 when you're when you're describing stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 like what these women want i'm like yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 it's possible and it's entirely possible\cb1 \
\cb3 but you it's better to start young um\cb1 \
\cb3 but anyway so my brother\cb1 \
\cb3 he had been trying to date in his race\cb1 \
\cb3 and um it just wasn't it wasn't hidden\cb1 \
\cb3 the women were\cb1 \
\cb3 very demanding but not very giving and\cb1 \
\cb3 he would come to me\cb1 \
\cb3 and he would say you know what should i\cb1 \
\cb3 do and\cb1 \
\cb3 to me my brother is like you can't get\cb1 \
\cb3 no better than my brother he's lost\cb1 \
\cb3 captain in the army is he older or he's\cb1 \
\cb3 younger he's one year younger\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so he's law school captain in the\cb1 \
\cb3 military\cb1 \
\cb3 you know getting ready to take company\cb1 \
\cb3 command\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape tall slim you know all the\cb1 \
\cb3 things\cb1 \
\cb3 straight out of central casting out of a\cb1 \
\cb3 movie he's he's wonderful but of course\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm biased he's my brother\cb1 \
\cb3 um and so anyway like i would say three\cb1 \
\cb3 years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 he came to me very cautious we were\cb1 \
\cb3 actually on a hike and we had gone up\cb1 \
\cb3 this mountain he was like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what do you think about me\cb1 \
\cb3 dating outside\cb1 \
\cb3 of our race and i was like i think\cb1 \
\cb3 what's taking you so long you you're\cb1 \
\cb3 getting oh you're oh mate we're from the\cb1 \
\cb3 south what's taking me so long\cb1 \
\cb3 and um you know he went for it and the\cb1 \
\cb3 first\cb1 \
\cb3 woman he dated outside of his race ended\cb1 \
\cb3 up accusing him\cb1 \
\cb3 of being all the things he wasn't she\cb1 \
\cb3 had even set up a marriage registry\cb1 \
\cb3 on um like a website before he'd even\cb1 \
\cb3 proposed because i\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought i i was you know doing some\cb1 \
\cb3 fact checking on her and i looked him up\cb1 \
\cb3 and i looked her up and she had posted a\cb1 \
\cb3 wedding date he had not proposed but i\cb1 \
\cb3 called him immediately and said did you\cb1 \
\cb3 propose and not tell me\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \

\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 we're from the south so it's it's and\cb1 \
\cb3 even though we have relatives who have\cb1 \
\cb3 been in interracial marriages it's\cb1 \

\cb3 on a different show it is harder you\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 different experiences when you marry\cb1 \
\cb3 someone outside your race\cb1 \
\cb3 well he came to you he came to his older\cb1 \
\cb3 sister\cb1 \

\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 i am the king you will not be\cb1 \
\cb3 all right i had to play that but see i\cb1 \
\cb3 think it shows the difference that black\cb1 \
\cb3 men still have for black women that even\cb1 \
\cb3 he stepped his sister in a way it was\cb1 \
\cb3 like i don't know how she's gonna take\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're like bruh i think the world\cb1 \
\cb3 of you and you sure did this a minute\cb1 \
\cb3 ago\cb1 \
\cb3 and i think that's a good thing to tell\cb1 \
\cb3 them but um\cb1 \
\cb3 have you always felt that way or did you\cb1 \
\cb3 just kind of start to realize that\cb1 \
\cb3 hey man there's not a lot of good\cb1 \
\cb3 choices out here for a man like my\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 i think i realized it more with uh my\cb1 \
\cb3 husband\cb1 \
\cb3 has a lot of single friends who\cb1 \
\cb3 i i think you would consider them\cb1 \
\cb3 henry's\cb1 \
\cb3 they're all high earners they're they're\cb1 \
\cb3 good guys and\cb1 \
\cb3 they're all still single and looking\cb1 \
\cb3 and i i would i guess i didn't notice it\cb1 \
\cb3 at the beginning of our marriage because\cb1 \
\cb3 we got married very young we were 22\cb1 \
\cb3 just out of college right right\cb1 \
\cb3 um so i didn't pay attention to it then\cb1 \
\cb3 because i felt like we\cb1 \
\cb3 we were like i said abnormal for getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married young\cb1 \
\cb3 you know yeah we're normal as french\cb1 \
\cb3 toast that wasn't the right thing to do\cb1 \
\cb3 [Laughter]\cb1 \
\cb3 but like when we were starting to get to\cb1 \
\cb3 be 26 27 i'm like why haven't you been\cb1 \
\cb3 in anybody's wedding like what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on with your friends why aren't they\cb1 \
\cb3 getting married\cb1 \
\cb3 and my husband would just say like oh\cb1 \
\cb3 well they're dating\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh yeah they're not they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 settling down\cb1 \
\cb3 and occasionally like me and my husband\cb1 \
\cb3 our last name is right as you can see so\cb1 \
\cb3 we're we're called the right house and\cb1 \
\cb3 people bring their\cb1 \
\cb3 significant others to the right house\cb1 \
\cb3 basically for i don't want to say\cb1 \
\cb3 but but to run it by us before they take\cb1 \
\cb3 it to their parents because we're like\cb1 \
\cb3 the old\cb1 \
\cb3 people of our friend group well here's\cb1 \
\cb3 what i need you to do me anybody need to\cb1 \
\cb3 do do me as this\cb1 \
\cb3 i need you to send me an email i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 do a follow-up broadcast of this\cb1 \
\cb3 but i need to keep cycling through this\cb1 \
\cb3 i think this is a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation that actually we can kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of build on and i'm gonna need some\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 other than just myself because this\cb1 \
\cb3 platform\cb1 \
\cb3 i i run the channel but it's gonna be\cb1 \
\cb3 bigger than me\cb1 \
\cb3 and i need folks that like you that have\cb1 \
\cb3 lived it got credibility to speak about\cb1 \
\cb3 it so\cb1 \
\cb3 it could be more received by other\cb1 \
\cb3 people can you do that for me\cb1 \
\cb3 um sure i'm gonna i'll put my my email\cb1 \
\cb3 address\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the moderators will put it in in the\cb1 \
\cb3 chat room okay\cb1 \
\cb3 okay sounds good all right thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 miss right bye-bye uh\cb1 \
\cb3 all right look um\cb1 \
\cb3 you know my guess is\cb1 \
\cb3 no black woman wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 have to think that their son or their\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 would be damn near forced to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 outside of black women that's just not\cb1 \
\cb3 how human beings are\cb1 \
\cb3 our brains are set up we're set up to\cb1 \
\cb3 want to pick ourselves\cb1 \
\cb3 so when i say that a lot of times\cb1 \
\cb3 brothers are\cb1 \
\cb3 uh brothers are very loyal that's why\cb1 \
\cb3 sarah unreached yourself i laughed when\cb1 \
\cb3 i heard somebody say women sisters are\cb1 \
\cb3 more loyal i'm like i think if black\cb1 \
\cb3 women could\cb1 \
\cb3 date out like black men many of them\cb1 \
\cb3 would have done it just my opinion sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 should uh should competitive or\cb1 \
\cb3 successful high value men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 if they can't find um potential spouses\cb1 \
\cb3 in their race\cb1 \
\cb3 they cannot find yeah if they cannot but\cb1 \
\cb3 if they if they can if it's possible\cb1 \
\cb3 then yes but\cb1 \
\cb3 i will admit it's very difficult to find\cb1 \
\cb3 good matches\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly even in my experience just\cb1 \
\cb3 having friends\cb1 \
\cb3 is difficult so marrying\cb1 \
\cb3 me i did ask this question earlier sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 so maybe you could answer it for me um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you just had a ballpark how many how\cb1 \
\cb3 many people should you date\cb1 \
\cb3 before you consider dating out honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe like\cb1 \
\cb3 two or three or just two or three yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 see i'm allowed i'm you laughing sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 because when i've heard\cb1 \
\cb3 i've heard some black women say yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 when i hear black men talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 they did it out and i'm like well they\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't dead at all black women they've\cb1 \
\cb3 only dated like two or three and i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 like well\cb1 \
\cb3 and i started thinking i'm like well how\cb1 \
\cb3 many women do these\cb1 \
\cb3 do these women think men should date\cb1 \
\cb3 before they can draw a picture i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking\cb1 \
\cb3 so it shocks me to hear you say two or\cb1 \
\cb3 three because when a man says two or\cb1 \
\cb3 three they get screamed at\cb1 \
\cb3 well honestly i feel like you can't you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't date all black women\cb1 \
\cb3 you you ha you have to meet you have to\cb1 \
\cb3 try and just date the few that you see\cb1 \
\cb3 that you find attractive but if you keep\cb1 \
\cb3 running on blanks then maybe it's time\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 expand well how about how about this\cb1 \
\cb3 i think that when a man becomes\cb1 \
\cb3 successful and competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 that women make themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 kind of in his presence\cb1 \
\cb3 that's very true i think i mean i've\cb1 \
\cb3 seen that men pick\cb1 \
\cb3 from the women that are around that's\cb1 \
\cb3 why boaz are ruth in the bible\cb1 \
\cb3 you know boaz didn't go looking for ruth\cb1 \
\cb3 ruth was happening to be around\cb1 \
\cb3 so um thank you for adding that in uh\cb1 \
\cb3 miss henson has something she wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 add\cb1 \
\cb3 sarah can you hold on just a second okay\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and get miss henson in here\cb1 \
\cb3 miss henson\cb1 \
\cb3 you got your hand raised so you must\cb1 \
\cb3 want to give it to me all right miss\cb1 \
\cb3 henson go ahead don't meet yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 hi you need to mute\cb1 \
\cb3 the youtube channels and things in the\cb1 \
\cb3 background\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so yeah what do you got for me on\cb1 \
\cb3 the topic\cb1 \
\cb3 um so i think that you're right i think\cb1 \
\cb3 that no high value black men should wait\cb1 \
\cb3 around\cb1 \
\cb3 because i think the exact same thing for\cb1 \
\cb3 black women i actually just had a friend\cb1 \
\cb3 who married outside of his race i went\cb1 \
\cb3 to their wedding about two years ago\cb1 \
\cb3 he did marry a white woman beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 couple and he is a\cb1 \
\cb3 captain now he is a policeman and\cb1 \
\cb3 i thought that it was beautiful but\cb1 \
\cb3 again where he lives he lives out in\cb1 \
\cb3 boston there isn't a lot of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 to choose from and the ones that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know they're already choose from you\cb1 \
\cb3 know you have to take your pick and so\cb1 \
\cb3 yes he did marry\cb1 \
\cb3 a white woman but i i thought that the\cb1 \
\cb3 union was beautiful so i'm gonna tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you right now i've had a couple in my\cb1 \
\cb3 group\cb1 \
\cb3 get together and she's in boston and\cb1 \
\cb3 he's in atlanta but they met in my group\cb1 \
\cb3 or else they never would have crossed\cb1 \
\cb3 paths\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you mentioned something about\cb1 \
\cb3 successful competitive and high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men i think the successful competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value women have the same options\cb1 \
\cb3 as well\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the trick um it's the\cb1 \
\cb3 i think everybody understands that they\cb1 \
\cb3 should not wait the problem is these\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 these these two successful groups of\cb1 \
\cb3 people don't seem to be able to find one\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 do you think that's possible do you\cb1 \
\cb3 think that could be it\cb1 \
\cb3 she muted herself go ahead and mute\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i absolutely think that's it because\cb1 \
\cb3 you might have a successful black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that's in california who's doing really\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 she may be working her way up in a\cb1 \
\cb3 company you may have another black man\cb1 \
\cb3 that's\cb1 \
\cb3 over in seattle and so\cb1 \
\cb3 we're placed all over the country right\cb1 \
\cb3 and so we may not\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna tell you miss hanson i really\cb1 \
\cb3 wouldn't i didn't that group i made on\cb1 \
\cb3 facebook was just kind of like on a\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i'm just trying and when i\cb1 \
\cb3 say four couples have met\cb1 \
\cb3 in 90 days and one's talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 marriage and none of them are in the\cb1 \
\cb3 same city\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm like i agree with you 100 about\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 me and myself i'm single i'm 27. um i\cb1 \
\cb3 won't say what city or state i live in\cb1 \
\cb3 it's okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but definitely i'm working my way way up\cb1 \
\cb3 i just had an interview at four today\cb1 \
\cb3 with a very established luxury retailer\cb1 \
\cb3 and so\cb1 \
\cb3 of course i'm looking for somebody who\cb1 \
\cb3 can bring a lot to the table\cb1 \
\cb3 like what you're saying and so as a 27\cb1 \
\cb3 year old i just went to the gym today\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm keeping myself\cb1 \
\cb3 up and i have an interest in black men\cb1 \
\cb3 as well as other races\cb1 \
\cb3 but bringing it back to black men is\cb1 \
\cb3 that what that is what we're talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 and as far as my friend goes he met his\cb1 \
\cb3 wife in boston she's gorgeous she's\cb1 \
\cb3 white the union was beautiful and he\cb1 \
\cb3 found who was\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean she was fit she's gorgeous she's\cb1 \
\cb3 you know\cb1 \
\cb3 like you said like you mean\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i you know it's a hard pill to\cb1 \
\cb3 swallow but it is what it is as far as\cb1 \
\cb3 me i'm keeping myself up and i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have a victim\cb1 \
\cb3 mindset what about let me let me say\cb1 \
\cb3 this while i get on to the next person\cb1 \
\cb3 i would consider a matchmaker\cb1 \
\cb3 matchmakers is one thing that i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 think enough people consider\cb1 \
\cb3 uh because in effect that's kind of what\cb1 \
\cb3 happened in my group it was a match make\cb1 \
\cb3 of sorts\cb1 \
\cb3 and i you know um if you're if you're\cb1 \
\cb3 moving on up\cb1 \
\cb3 as you say yes uh yes it's about\cb1 \
\cb3 it's about the connections more than\cb1 \
\cb3 anything else i got more people coming\cb1 \
\cb3 in\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for uh adding to the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation i'm going to drop you back\cb1 \
\cb3 in\cb1 \
\cb3 uh thank you um buck\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't pronounce your name i don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 it wrong uh\cb1 \
\cb3 hi i'm mute yourself hi there how you\cb1 \
\cb3 doing kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm well um so the question is should\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 so i think that's a really tough\cb1 \
\cb3 question right because\cb1 \
\cb3 on that one i want to be logical right\cb1 \
\cb3 the logical answer is to just say yes\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but i mean i just feel like we can't\cb1 \
\cb3 really give up on one another\cb1 \
\cb3 because black men and black women i\cb1 \
\cb3 think of us as a unit\cb1 \
\cb3 so um i i mean i understand the\cb1 \
\cb3 situation like in the dating market but\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 like to hear when people make you sound\cb1 \
\cb3 as though there are no good black women\cb1 \
\cb3 right\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's the same thing from the other\cb1 \
\cb3 side as well you know sometimes you hear\cb1 \
\cb3 black women talking and you're like okay\cb1 \
\cb3 please stop so i mean the logical answer\cb1 \
\cb3 to your question is yes of course you\cb1 \
\cb3 know do what's best\cb1 \
\cb3 you said you don't like to see us give\cb1 \
\cb3 up on one another\cb1 \
\cb3 um yeah all right how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 35 okay so you're old enough to\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to answer this question you know\cb1 \
\cb3 how i framed it\cb1 \
\cb3 right um 80 percent\cb1 \
\cb3 of black women are overweight\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i'm sorry i\cb1 \
\cb3 i gotta ask who's give who who do you\cb1 \
\cb3 think gave up first\cb1 \
\cb3 um i mean i think that's this is your\cb1 \
\cb3 opinion now i'm not gonna hold you to\cb1 \
\cb3 stats here\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i mean yeah if you think about it\cb1 \
\cb3 in that sense\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah black women can be more competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 i've never\cb1 \
\cb3 heard that stat before so it's quite an\cb1 \
\cb3 issue\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah it's like everywhere i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i definitely think that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 but i also think that's a situation that\cb1 \
\cb3 can be remedied right\cb1 \
\cb3 it can be but\cb1 \
\cb3 if if men are just asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 fit cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 single women right it's not much\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not and i don't know what region\cb1 \
\cb3 of the country you live in but\cb1 \
\cb3 get out huh houston i live in houston\cb1 \
\cb3 texas well then\cb1 \
\cb3 i l so i know think i know you can walk\cb1 \
\cb3 around houston and see\cb1 \
\cb3 the average sister is not a dress size\cb1 \
\cb3 four\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so i hear you say you don't give up\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you're a man who's already gone\cb1 \
\cb3 out and done the things he needs to do\cb1 \
\cb3 to be competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 what's he picking from and even if they\cb1 \
\cb3 are in the fit category are they getting\cb1 \
\cb3 a cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 i hear what you're saying here's what i\cb1 \
\cb3 would like i would like black women to\cb1 \
\cb3 be more competitive i would like black\cb1 \
\cb3 women to say all right\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to give the black man what he\cb1 \
\cb3 wants cooperation and fitness and single\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to do that for him because see\cb1 \
\cb3 we tell a lot we tell women a lot you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need to work out for me and i say\cb1 \
\cb3 yes you do\cb1 \
\cb3 because i need to work for a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 you're goddamn right i can't have a\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful woman and no money\cb1 \
\cb3 makes sense i mean these suits cost\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean oh and i can't walk around so i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 we we need you say we're we're you say\cb1 \
\cb3 you think of us as a unit or our team\cb1 \
\cb3 mm-hmm i would i would say that that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not our culture\cb1 \
\cb3 our country we're a bunch of individuals\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm i'm um i'm nigerian i don't know if\cb1 \
\cb3 you can tell yeah i can't and\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i i definitely find that to be true\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a lot of you know divisiveness\cb1 \
\cb3 well in order but i think you're only\cb1 \
\cb3 something though in order to get\cb1 \
\cb3 on the same page we have to think about\cb1 \
\cb3 ourselves as a team\cb1 \
\cb3 because in that case you do things for\cb1 \
\cb3 your teammates\cb1 \
\cb3 that you may not necessarily do for\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah that's fair okay let me go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 and cycle through\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um sarah\cb1 \
\cb3 i had you there sarah camille i'm gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 get you\cb1 \
\cb3 camille go ahead good evening kevin how\cb1 \
\cb3 are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm good um should single competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful high value men marry out what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have for me\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm i'm i'm oh god\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 52 years old okay and i've been\cb1 \
\cb3 married for almost\cb1 \
\cb3 21 years uh met and married\cb1 \
\cb3 in about a year when i met my husband my\cb1 \
\cb3 best friend met and married in four\cb1 \
\cb3 months\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly it don't take all that long now\cb1 \
\cb3 does it it don't take that long at\cb1 \
\cb3 all these women they come into a\cb1 \
\cb3 situation and i\cb1 \
\cb3 understood i was turning 30\cb1 \
\cb3 31 between 30 and 32 and i understood\cb1 \
\cb3 the clock was ticking and something just\cb1 \
\cb3 said\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to be married you've got to\cb1 \
\cb3 get out here and get out here seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was an internal thing that just\cb1 \
\cb3 told me that i knew high risk pregnancy\cb1 \
\cb3 was 35\cb1 \
\cb3 so i got no business trying to have kids\cb1 \
\cb3 or meet a man at 35\cb1 \
\cb3 after my career is established right but\cb1 \
\cb3 the sad thing is i'm a special ed\cb1 \
\cb3 teacher right now\cb1 \
\cb3 and i have women on my caseload in their\cb1 \
\cb3 20s with seven kids each\cb1 \
\cb3 and they don't even report we're virtual\cb1 \
\cb3 right now they don't report the kids i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not coming to school someone i got to\cb1 \
\cb3 work\cb1 \
\cb3 i got to do this and i'm real harsh\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'll tell\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the women you know we're\cb1 \
\cb3 preparing these boys\cb1 \
\cb3 to be married to grow up and be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 take care of themselves\cb1 \
\cb3 and you are not and this is a team\cb1 \
\cb3 effort\cb1 \
\cb3 right but they're busy and a lot of them\cb1 \
\cb3 are my friends on facebook they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 even know it and i'm looking at pictures\cb1 \
\cb3 posted up holding bottles\cb1 \
\cb3 stinking weaves in a hair salon i have\cb1 \
\cb3 never had a weave in my head my children\cb1 \
\cb3 have never had weeds and i'm a hair\cb1 \
\cb3 stylist\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all gonna y'all gonna y'all gonna get\cb1 \
\cb3 me shot talk about these stinky weaves\cb1 \
\cb3 but i know\cb1 \
\cb3 i know and why not be you beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 as it is and so now my only son is 13.\cb1 \
\cb3 i have daughters three daughters 17 26\cb1 \
\cb3 and 30.\cb1 \
\cb3 that i don't have any grandchildren i\cb1 \
\cb3 taught them it's a marriage first\cb1 \
\cb3 and then if you don't get married then\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't have children that's just how\cb1 \
\cb3 it goes\cb1 \
\cb3 right um so my 13 year old lady i had a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation with him\cb1 \
\cb3 because i was lit he listened to your\cb1 \
\cb3 show with me in the car on the way\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 13 year old yes my son he listens\cb1 \
\cb3 to you\cb1 \
\cb3 with me and i asked him the question you\cb1 \
\cb3 had a 24 year old girl\cb1 \
\cb3 on your show and she had a child when\cb1 \
\cb3 she was 14\cb1 \
\cb3 yes so i turned and i asked him i said\cb1 \
\cb3 if you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you make it to the nfl or when you do\cb1 \
\cb3 i said would you date her\cb1 \
\cb3 and he said no he's 13 never dated\cb1 \
\cb3 and i said why he said because i have\cb1 \
\cb3 other options\cb1 \
\cb3 as a 13 year old he understood that\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 and the single biggest mistake black\cb1 \
\cb3 women are making is they're having\cb1 \
\cb3 babies they're doing things out of order\cb1 \
\cb3 there's an\cb1 \
\cb3 order to everything and\cb1 \
\cb3 i try to tell women and young girls they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to listen to me but my story\cb1 \
\cb3 is so tripped out because i got that\cb1 \
\cb3 revelation like you talked about after\cb1 \
\cb3 the fact i had two daughters coming into\cb1 \
\cb3 my marriage and my husband had two sons\cb1 \
\cb3 but i understood what that cost me\cb1 \
\cb3 and i wasn't going to say they didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 cost me nothing\cb1 \
\cb3 my husband is a henry i basically stay\cb1 \
\cb3 at home\cb1 \
\cb3 i teach because i just wanted to go to\cb1 \
\cb3 work right\cb1 \
\cb3 he's an excellent black man there's some\cb1 \
\cb3 good ones out there but black women\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want the good black men\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't you you know what uh you over\cb1 \
\cb3 here going to church i'm out that past\cb1 \
\cb3 collection plate\cb1 \
\cb3 but you gave me some things i really\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to be on i need to\cb1 \
\cb3 i need to get to this other question\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah come here\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it though thank you sis thank\cb1 \

\cb3 competitive at least i'm remaining\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive\cb1 \

\cb3 this is a bunch of bs you call in too\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll ask is that you are respectful we\cb1 \
\cb3 can have a respectful back and forth\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 but i really would like to know what you\cb1 \
\cb3 expect\cb1 \
\cb3 men to do\cb1 \
\cb3 and what i'm seeing is\cb1 \
\cb3 we're expecting competitive successful\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 to do even more work and i'm seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 most women are not doing the minimum\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a hard pill to swallow that's\cb1 \
\cb3 what a lot of the callers have said\cb1 \
\cb3 my brother is a captain in this in law\cb1 \
\cb3 school he's gone on to make himself\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 and we're talking about women in their\cb1 \
\cb3 20s who are dressed size\cb1 \
\cb3 12 and 14 and 16s and 18s you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 even doing the\cb1 \
\cb3 minimum fit\cb1 \
\cb3 the cooperative he's not asking you to\cb1 \
\cb3 be a millionaire\cb1 \
\cb3 or a brain scientist or a rocket surgeon\cb1 \

\cb3 room maybe she'll get it in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room\cb1 \

\cb3 minimum\cb1 \
\cb3 what are they supposed to do\cb1 \
\cb3 you have no\cb1 \
\cb3 sound no audio\cb1 \
\cb3 nandi nandi\cb1 \
\cb3 back to shock azula on your others\cb1 \
\cb3 and see the thing is i think you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i think a lot of you guys know that\cb1 \
\cb3 for the men who are out here who are\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive you can't ask them to wait\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why when i hear women say i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 addressed size 12 i'm a 14.\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm working on it i'm like i need a\cb1 \
\cb3 sense of urgency from you\cb1 \
\cb3 because while you're working on it\cb1 \
\cb3 you're wasting time\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to the uh to the miss right\cb1 \
\cb3 she said they got married at 22. good\cb1 \
\cb3 for you\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all got married when y'all was too\cb1 \
\cb3 dumb to know any better\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i was too dumb to know any better\cb1 \
\cb3 you were still living off ikea\cb1 \
\cb3 ramen noodles um\cb1 \
\cb3 lunch meat you know going to outback\cb1 \
\cb3 steakhouse was special\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all was on sleeping bags tv dinners\cb1 \
\cb3 10 pound bags of fryers kool-aid\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i'm talking about you know\cb1 \
\cb3 having sex on the on the floor because\cb1 \
\cb3 the floor was more comfortable in that\cb1 \
\cb3 cheap ass bed\cb1 \
\cb3 you know buying all the generic stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 because you couldn't afford del monte\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 it was good times\cb1 \
\cb3 living that little hubble drinking that\cb1 \
\cb3 little you know\cb1 \
\cb3 box wine and carrying on because you\cb1 \
\cb3 couldn't afford kendall jackson because\cb1 \
\cb3 you thought kendall jackson was\cb1 \
\cb3 expensive\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah she was too damn young to know any\cb1 \
\cb3 better and y'all grew up together and\cb1 \
\cb3 you got 12 or 13 or 15 years of\cb1 \
\cb3 chronicling\cb1 \
\cb3 each other's life\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's the value you know yeah you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to you want to mate that you're\cb1 \
\cb3 attracted to\cb1 \
\cb3 and sexy and also it's to chronicle your\cb1 \
\cb3 life so somebody can say i've seen this\cb1 \
\cb3 person\cb1 \
\cb3 and they have grown from here to here to\cb1 \
\cb3 here to here that's why anniversaries\cb1 \
\cb3 holidays and things like that are so\cb1 \
\cb3 important you chronicle the markers of\cb1 \
\cb3 life so when somebody transitions\cb1 \
\cb3 goes on and shuffles off this mortal\cb1 \
\cb3 coil people can say\cb1 \
\cb3 i was there through the journey right\cb1 \
\cb3 now so many of us are walking on our own\cb1 \
\cb3 journeys well competitive successful\cb1 \
\cb3 high value men\cb1 \
\cb3 they understand the network the first\cb1 \
\cb3 network is family\cb1 \
\cb3 and that is an integral part of a\cb1 \
\cb3 success\cb1 \
\cb3 for a competitive successful high value\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not worried about this scarcity\cb1 \
\cb3 demand said i'll make a million dollars\cb1 \
\cb3 and have a chick take me half that ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't come into these conversations\cb1 \
\cb3 because these men know they can go out\cb1 \
\cb3 and make it\cb1 \
\cb3 anything that they could possibly lose\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't care they're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 they can lose it in the market lose it\cb1 \
\cb3 in divorce you can lose it to go back\cb1 \
\cb3 and make it again\cb1 \
\cb3 these guys don't think like that their\cb1 \
\cb3 brain ain't set up like that all right\cb1 \
\cb3 did you like your song\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't see ike's response but ike's\cb1 \
\cb3 song is dope\cb1 \
\cb3 i am the king and will not be i\cb1 \
\cb3 am okay there's nandi okay\cb1 \
\cb3 unmute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 can you hear me now i can hear you now\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm good how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 good what you got for me um\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm so the question is should successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive or high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out i would say no\cb1 \
\cb3 okay tell me why um because you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what i have\cb1 \
\cb3 dated out and uh\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not the life it's not the life\cb1 \
\cb3 they do not offer what they would really\cb1 \
\cb3 have for a black woman they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 who's they they meaning\cb1 \
\cb3 men who are not black okay well what\cb1 \
\cb3 would you tell black men though\cb1 \
\cb3 are you telling the black men that their\cb1 \
\cb3 experience will be the same\cb1 \
\cb3 no i would tell black men that you need\cb1 \
\cb3 to stick with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 why because you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 women who are not black who are white\cb1 \
\cb3 who are asian\cb1 \
\cb3 who are hispanic they will not give you\cb1 \
\cb3 what a black woman can give you what is\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 which is the experience and the\cb1 \
\cb3 the culture they can't give you\cb1 \
\cb3 what uh what is is offered\cb1 \
\cb3 they they can give you what is outside\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on okay i know you think\cb1 \
\cb3 you're dropping knowledge\cb1 \
\cb3 but you're not really saying anything\cb1 \
\cb3 okay they cannot give you anything the\cb1 \
\cb3 culture what is the what does that mean\cb1 \
\cb3 men are very logical and so what\cb1 \
\cb3 what is a black man going to get from a\cb1 \
\cb3 black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that he can't get from these other women\cb1 \
\cb3 you're seeing the culture what does that\cb1 \
\cb3 mean\cb1 \
\cb3 well you know what i just saw a video\cb1 \
\cb3 today and it was for a rapper\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was on um vogue.com\cb1 \
\cb3 and i don't give a damn about a rapper\cb1 \
\cb3 over here i'm talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care about athlete no ma'am i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't care about athletes entertainment\cb1 \
\cb3 no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no ma'am understand\cb1 \
\cb3 those people don't live our lives that's\cb1 \
\cb3 why i don't talk about them\cb1 \
\cb3 i talk about i'm talking about athletes\cb1 \
\cb3 entertainers or famous people\cb1 \
\cb3 talk about regular us and see what you\cb1 \
\cb3 what you\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're telling me is black men\cb1 \
\cb3 should stick with black women for the\cb1 \
\cb3 sake of blackness\cb1 \
\cb3 well yeah well but but but what do black\cb1 \
\cb3 men\cb1 \
\cb3 want from their women and they want to\cb1 \
\cb3 raise\cb1 \
\cb3 what do they want from their women they\cb1 \
\cb3 want they want to raise good black\cb1 \
\cb3 children and they need to have that from\cb1 \
\cb3 now\cb1 \
\cb3 no no you skipped all the way to the\cb1 \
\cb3 kids\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll ask you again what do black men\cb1 \
\cb3 want from\cb1 \
\cb3 their women\cb1 \
\cb3 they want good black women who will who\cb1 \
\cb3 will be\cb1 \
\cb3 their women who will who will do what\cb1 \
\cb3 what they need their women to do\cb1 \
\cb3 and do okay cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 yes cooperation black women known to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 they are in mass okay so black women\cb1 \
\cb3 so black men want cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 i agree yeah you as a black woman just\cb1 \
\cb3 said black women are not known to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah okay so that's one thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 argumentative\cb1 \
\cb3 so if men want cooperation\cb1 \
\cb3 they cannot get it from black women\cb1 \
\cb3 according to you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well you know what not from every\cb1 \
\cb3 black one okay man but okay okay okay\cb1 \
\cb3 again\cb1 \
\cb3 again see that's see we were doing so\cb1 \
\cb3 good\cb1 \
\cb3 so now you're going to try to go into\cb1 \
\cb3 the not all\cb1 \
\cb3 no walt no ma'am let's stick in the\cb1 \
\cb3 stick in them in the general\cb1 \
\cb3 in general okay in general so\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't get cooperation what else do\cb1 \
\cb3 what else do black men want from\cb1 \
\cb3 from women uh they they want natural\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty okay and part of that is\cb1 \
\cb3 fitness fitness yes fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so so let me let me ask you a\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 okay are you aware what percentage of\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 are overweight\cb1 \
\cb3 uh gosh even even my son\cb1 \
\cb3 said that he sees a whole bunch of fat\cb1 \
\cb3 what percentage what percentage i have\cb1 \
\cb3 100\cb1 \
\cb3 what percent i'm probably\cb1 \
\cb3 about 80 yep so if 8 out of 10 or 80 out\cb1 \
\cb3 of 100\cb1 \
\cb3 black women are\cb1 \
\cb3 if they are overweight and according to\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 they are not cooperative they are not\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative so\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 those are the two things they say they\cb1 \
\cb3 want\cb1 \
\cb3 and they can't get them tell me why\cb1 \
\cb3 you're telling me why\cb1 \
\cb3 so basically what you're coming down to\cb1 \
\cb3 is your argument is just do it for\cb1 \
\cb3 blackness\cb1 \
\cb3 you know no no man listen what i'm about\cb1 \
\cb3 to say what your argument was\cb1 \
\cb3 is an impassioned argument do it for the\cb1 \
\cb3 sake of blackness just do it for the\cb1 \
\cb3 blackness\cb1 \
\cb3 now you're not going to get what you\cb1 \
\cb3 want you're not going to get cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 because we're not known for that we're\cb1 \
\cb3 known for being the opposite of\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen listen and you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to get fit because 80\cb1 \
\cb3 of us are overweight even my son says\cb1 \
\cb3 that so you're basically telling black\cb1 \
\cb3 men you shouldn't get what you want so\cb1 \
\cb3 you would tell your son\cb1 \
\cb3 that you raised kept out of trouble kept\cb1 \
\cb3 out of jail kept out of the prison\cb1 \
\cb3 kept out of the cemetery you would tell\cb1 \
\cb3 him to go get a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and spend the rest of his life with a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who has not given him what he\cb1 \
\cb3 wants\cb1 \
\cb3 jeez you know when you put it like that\cb1 \
\cb3 well that's the way i needed to put it\cb1 \
\cb3 because if i just put it out in there\cb1 \
\cb3 with men and women you could argue it\cb1 \
\cb3 but when it's your son\cb1 \
\cb3 when it's your brother then it gets real\cb1 \
\cb3 yes and you have something you would say\cb1 \
\cb3 you would tell your boy to go get a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 if he said mama i looked high and low\cb1 \
\cb3 and they all uncle they're uncooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and they're not fit\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you tell them to just not get\cb1 \
\cb3 anything\cb1 \
\cb3 ah okay you know that is really good\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly and this is the question your\cb1 \
\cb3 son and so many brothers are struggling\cb1 \
\cb3 with because they\cb1 \
\cb3 like black women but they can't they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't get even the basic stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 oh my god well i want my son to be with\cb1 \
\cb3 the black woman\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but here's what here's what's gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 happen black woman here's what's gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 have to happen then\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll tell you what's gonna have to\cb1 \
\cb3 happen you ready\cb1 \
\cb3 black mothers like you are going to have\cb1 \
\cb3 to start talking to black mothers\cb1 \
\cb3 of black daughters and start fixing that\cb1 \
\
\cb3 black women like you are going to have\cb1 \
\cb3 to start getting making an understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 that fathers need to be in these houses\cb1 \
\cb3 because if not you start getting the\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters\cb1 \
\cb3 that are produced with no supervision\cb1 \
\cb3 because you know good and well\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't go to a black woman and say\cb1 \
\cb3 nothing to her about her daughter she\cb1 \
\cb3 ready to fight you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's true that's true so i'm not so\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying it to be hurtful\cb1 \
\cb3 what i'm saying it too is to let women\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 when you talk about men and women it's\cb1 \
\cb3 easy but when you got a son\cb1 \
\cb3 or a brother it's like well wait a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute\cb1 \
\cb3 they shouldn't survive the the the\cb1 \
\cb3 madness of being a black man in this\cb1 \
\cb3 country to only deal with a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 off the rip ain't gonna be cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and ain't gonna even try to be fit for\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i don't want to see that type\cb1 \
\cb3 of daughter-in-law exactly\cb1 \
\cb3 and then what about the other one you\cb1 \
\cb3 know because single was the only other\cb1 \
\cb3 comportion\cb1 \
\cb3 and then you know i'm not going to even\cb1 \
\cb3 start throwing the subject but you do\cb1 \
\cb3 know most of the kids here are born out\cb1 \
\cb3 of wedlock so\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that's also a factor too the\cb1 \
\cb3 older you get\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's why i did this subject not to\cb1 \
\cb3 trigger but just to get women like\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself to\cb1 \
\cb3 to think about it and you came in like\cb1 \
\cb3 no they should stay but now you're like\cb1 \
\cb3 well damn\cb1 \
\cb3 see well you know i i have a son and a\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter to raise\cb1 \
\cb3 and i want to get the best\cb1 \
\cb3 matches for them but i honestly called\cb1 \
\cb3 in\cb1 \
\cb3 to talk about me but\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i do need to think about what's\cb1 \
\cb3 going on how is your daughter\cb1 \
\cb3 with my children i have a i have a\cb1 \
\cb3 seven-year-old daughter and\cb1 \
\cb3 a nine-year-old son where's your where's\cb1 \
\cb3 your where's the father\cb1 \
\cb3 uh my my husband is deceased he\cb1 \
\cb3 he died at 39. okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 uh a solid male role model because\cb1 \
\cb3 daughters need fathers\cb1 \
\cb3 and sons needs to be phil but i've been\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been watching your show\cb1 \
\cb3 for a minute and i'm feeling like\cb1 \
\cb3 it's i'm it's over for me um\cb1 \
\cb3 and see and see that's the thing that\cb1 \
\cb3 this that's a different show\cb1 \
\cb3 but no but there's\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a solution for single mothers\cb1 \
\cb3 that don't that don't necessarily exist\cb1 \
\cb3 for\cb1 \
\cb3 others there's a solution for that too\cb1 \
\cb3 but i don't want to get i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 get derailed on that tonight\cb1 \
\cb3 but main thing is poor resources into\cb1 \
\cb3 your son\cb1 \
\cb3 because guess what the community is\cb1 \
\cb3 built by men\cb1 \
\cb3 and right now we're not producing the we\cb1 \
\cb3 need to produce more competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 man well you know i'm i'm in georgia and\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been thinking about\cb1 \
\cb3 sending my son to a military school\cb1 \
\cb3 just to help him to get the the type of\cb1 \
\cb3 guidance that he needs that i know that\cb1 \
\cb3 i can't really give him\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say that's a good idea i would\cb1 \
\cb3 say you would\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah wow all right now i'm gonna let you\cb1 \
\cb3 go i got some more people coming in\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it\cb1 \
\cb3 okay thank you so much that's how we\cb1 \
\cb3 have a phone call\cb1 \

\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm glad you can kind of start to\cb1 \
\cb3 see where men are coming from in this\cb1 \
\cb3 position\cb1 \
\cb3 i can um i don't know if you saw um\cb1 \
\cb3 today earlier on the reel uh jeannie mai\cb1 \
\cb3 who is dating jeezy i know you say you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't deal with uh\cb1 \
\cb3 the rappers and stuff no but the real is\cb1 \
\cb3 in my kind of sector so what happened\cb1 \
\cb3 so they were talking about being\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 uh-oh\cb1 \
\cb3 say that again yes she was oh here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 and um the other\cb1 \
\cb3 new the new the new woman she's black as\cb1 \
\cb3 well okay and adrian\cb1 \
\cb3 um garcelle something\cb1 \
\cb3 so when jeannie said that she's four she\cb1 \
\cb3 thinks that women should be submissive\cb1 \
\cb3 to men\cb1 \
\cb3 and that um she she's okay with going\cb1 \
\cb3 out into the world\cb1 \
\cb3 working and leading in her life and then\cb1 \
\cb3 coming home and\cb1 \
\cb3 being submissive to her partner oh jesus\cb1 \
\cb3 christ\cb1 \
\cb3 the ladies on the rail did not agree\cb1 \
\cb3 they did not necessarily they did not\cb1 \
\cb3 agree at all they just felt like it\cb1 \
\cb3 should be equal\cb1 \
\cb3 it should be equal everything and\cb1 \
\cb3 um it shouldn't it shouldn't not well\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess in a world where we're talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about um\cb1 \
\cb3 a high-valued man and him like\cb1 \
\cb3 supporting you\cb1 \
\cb3 and paying your bills i don't think\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a realistic thing to ask for\cb1 \
\cb3 things to be equal\cb1 \
\cb3 is he going to respect you yeah that's i\cb1 \
\cb3 mean that's giving if you're in a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 but equal no it's not going to be equal\cb1 \
\cb3 if he's working i'm going to check this\cb1 \
\cb3 out because that's a\cb1 \
\cb3 i see what you're talking about uh i\cb1 \
\cb3 need to do a little bit more work on\cb1 \
\cb3 that one\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but did you have anything you want to\cb1 \

\cb3 should competitive high value or\cb1 \
\cb3 successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out i believe they can\cb1 \
\cb3 ah no i know they can i'm asking should\cb1 \
\cb3 they\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's not a matter of shoot because\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't really tell somebody that they\cb1 \
\cb3 have to do something it's all about the\cb1 \
\cb3 will and it's all about the attraction\cb1 \
\cb3 that you have for somebody else\cb1 \
\cb3 you know why i'm asking whether or not\cb1 \
\cb3 they should i get that i get that i only\cb1 \
\cb3 can control me\cb1 \
\cb3 but the way you're framing the question\cb1 \
\cb3 it it\cb1 \
\cb3 the way i'm where you're framing it it's\cb1 \
\cb3 it's\cb1 \
\cb3 like uh well you can you can exercise\cb1 \
\cb3 the option if you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 um if they don't what's the option\cb1 \
\cb3 if they don't marry out do they have\cb1 \
\cb3 okay how about this do competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful high-value black men\cb1 \
\cb3 have equal amount of black\cb1 \
\cb3 female options as non-black female\cb1 \
\cb3 options yes they do\cb1 \
\cb3 oh they do so you're saying the numbers\cb1 \
\cb3 are the same\cb1 \
\cb3 really yes they do in that can\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead i gotta hear this okay\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm new to this channel so um bear with\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 but i want to say this i feel i know\cb1 \
\cb3 that the media\cb1 \
\cb3 portrays numbers in such a propagandic\cb1 \
\cb3 way\cb1 \
\cb3 that we're not doing at all well you\cb1 \
\cb3 know what i don't use\cb1 \
\cb3 media i use blackdemographics.com black\cb1 \
\cb3 statistics\cb1 \
\cb3 for black people by black people taken\cb1 \
\cb3 by black people analyzed by black people\cb1 \
\cb3 right so i just want to say that yes\cb1 \
\cb3 they do\cb1 \
\cb3 have they do have options to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 the black woman i am from africa okay\cb1 \
\cb3 continent is filled with so many people\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but but ma'am we're in the united\cb1 \
\cb3 states so i mean i\cb1 \
\cb3 do respect i don't really want to try to\cb1 \
\cb3 play the globe\cb1 \
\cb3 uh pan-africa thing people are here\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about people who\cb1 \
\cb3 can't afford to go to continent to go\cb1 \
\cb3 dating\cb1 \
\cb3 here you're trying to say that black men\cb1 \
\cb3 who are successful competitive or high\cb1 \
\cb3 value have\cb1 \
\cb3 a a plethora of black women to choose\cb1 \
\cb3 from\cb1 \
\cb3 they do okay then what would you say to\cb1 \
\cb3 all of the black women\cb1 \
\cb3 on this show tonight who say completely\cb1 \
\cb3 different\cb1 \
\cb3 well not only did they say they didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 they have sons\cb1 \
\cb3 and they have brothers who have\cb1 \
\cb3 had to do this because they can't find\cb1 \
\cb3 what you were saying is in ready supply\cb1 \
\cb3 okay i would tell them this you have\cb1 \
\cb3 one of your videos where you talked\cb1 \
\cb3 about being in the right place\cb1 \
\cb3 you have also talked about working on\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself to make yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 accessible to that type of man that you\cb1 \
\cb3 are looking for\cb1 \
\cb3 you work on yourself you put your best\cb1 \
\cb3 self out there\cb1 \
\cb3 you work on your physical you work on\cb1 \
\cb3 your attitude as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and you will get to that person or you\cb1 \
\cb3 will get no no\cb1 \
\cb3 see i understand what i've told women to\cb1 \
\cb3 do\cb1 \
\cb3 right but we got to start with the okay\cb1 \
\cb3 let's\cb1 \
\cb3 let's start here okay\cb1 \
\cb3 men want basically three things for\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperation fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 and single yes\cb1 \
\cb3 are black women in general thought to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 they are perceived as not being called\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not okay ma'am i'm not i can't do\cb1 \
\cb3 the perceived thing because\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're doing ma'am is not being you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 okay answer your question well i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 let's be reasonable okay because it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not perception\cb1 \
\cb3 you got i don't need no man i'm a strong\cb1 \
\cb3 independent black woman black women\cb1 \
\cb3 play the sapphire thing up and it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 a media\cb1 \
\cb3 construction if and if you said is\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to say that all i have to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is walk out on the streets of new york\cb1 \
\cb3 city philadelphia atlanta\cb1 \
\cb3 with a camera and i can show you in any\cb1 \
\cb3 given day\cb1 \
\cb3 right okay so if they're in general\cb1 \
\cb3 they're not perceived as being\cb1 \
\cb3 cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 that's one thing that men want that\cb1 \
\cb3 black women in general\cb1 \
\cb3 are not known for what about fitness\cb1 \
\cb3 they are not known for that either um\cb1 \
\cb3 may i make a point\cb1 \
\cb3 okay after i make my point so okay two\cb1 \
\cb3 of the three\cb1 \
\cb3 two of the three things right they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 right so where's the were these large\cb1 \
\cb3 numbers of available\cb1 \
\cb3 women okay\cb1 \
\cb3 is it my turn now if you answer me you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't but you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 the math doesn't add up man you're just\cb1 \
\cb3 telling me that there are a lot of women\cb1 \
\cb3 out there\cb1 \
\cb3 you just got to go to the right places\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 two of the three things that men want\cb1 \
\cb3 don't exist and you just want to act\cb1 \
\cb3 like that didn't happen\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not really acting like it didn't\cb1 \
\cb3 happen\cb1 \
\cb3 i just want to point out that there are\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 like myself and like some other women\cb1 \
\cb3 that i know black women\cb1 \
\cb3 that are into being fit that are\cb1 \
\cb3 incorporated that are into being\cb1 \
\cb3 submissively man\cb1 \
\cb3 and maybe those numbers are not adding\cb1 \
\cb3 up to the statistics that you see that's\cb1 \
\cb3 just what i want to point out that you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to go back to the anecdotal with\cb1 \
\cb3 you and the people you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i get it but that does not work for the\cb1 \
\cb3 for the population\cb1 \
\cb3 the whole population i get it and i get\cb1 \
\cb3 it so how do you\cb1 \
\cb3 i am 36. where's your husband\cb1 \
\cb3 i am single where's your fiance\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not engaged at all my fiance passed\cb1 \
\cb3 away okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so why aren't you married because he\cb1 \
\cb3 passed away last year\cb1 \
\cb3 i already hear that that's all right but\cb1 \
\cb3 you get what i'm saying\cb1 \
\cb3 i do i know you see\cb1 \
\cb3 what i gather is many women who come\cb1 \
\cb3 this conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 no disrespect are rather innumerate not\cb1 \
\cb3 really versed on the numbers\cb1 \
\cb3 and then so quick to throw numbers out\cb1 \
\cb3 as being\cb1 \
\cb3 white supremacy or media con construct\cb1 \
\cb3 constructed propaganda and that's simply\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 true right you can go out and see with\cb1 \
\cb3 your own\cb1 \
\cb3 eyes are you familiar with spelman\cb1 \
\cb3 college\cb1 \
\cb3 black college i am huh\cb1 \
\cb3 i am okay spelman college all-female\cb1 \
\cb3 college black college\cb1 \
\cb3 scrapped their entire athletics\cb1 \
\cb3 department and to take all that money\cb1 \
\cb3 to put it into student body health for\cb1 \
\cb3 women because\cb1 \
\cb3 the chancellor the the president of the\cb1 \
\cb3 school realized that\cb1 \
\cb3 young black women were coming to college\cb1 \
\cb3 at 18 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 overweight and obese\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am we cannot act like there's a\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're saying is true that they're\cb1 \
\cb3 just a\cb1 \
\cb3 plethora of fit cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and single black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and i agree with you there is that\cb1 \
\cb3 population as well\cb1 \
\cb3 and it is the vast majority of the\cb1 \
\cb3 percentage\cb1 \
\cb3 of the black women and like\cb1 \
\cb3 you asked me what would i say to them\cb1 \
\cb3 would be\cb1 \
\cb3 to take accountability well i\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for saying that but before you\cb1 \
\cb3 can do that you have to agree with what\cb1 \
\cb3 i said because you came on and said\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm wrong you said there are plenty of\cb1 \
\cb3 women and then\cb1 \
\cb3 five minutes later you're saying they're\cb1 \
\cb3 not enough and they need to take\cb1 \
\cb3 accountability\cb1 \
\cb3 so that i don't see how you square that\cb1 \
\cb3 circle\cb1 \
\cb3 what i we need from women like yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 is to\cb1 \
\cb3 to understand the reality that men are\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 and whether you like it or not just\cb1 \
\cb3 accept that men\cb1 \
\cb3 are not going to accept women who are\cb1 \
\cb3 not cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 and not fit and without black families\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't have black nothing and black\cb1 \
\cb3 men aren't going to accept it\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead um do you align cooperative\cb1 \
\cb3 with being submissive no i don't even\cb1 \
\cb3 talking submissive yet\cb1 \
\cb3 but cooperation just means you're easy\cb1 \
\cb3 to get along with\cb1 \
\cb3 and and you know submissive is something\cb1 \
\cb3 completely different submissive is a\cb1 \
\cb3 whole another character conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 but thank you for getting on man i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 little bit late appreciate you\cb1 \
\cb3 no problem thank you thank you very much\cb1 \
\cb3 yes\cb1 \
\cb3 see i've learned how to get around that\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive thing\cb1 \
\cb3 um mia\cb1 \
\cb3 me oh my gosh shop like a gyro hello\cb1 \
\cb3 so should competitive successful or high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out i definitely\cb1 \
\cb3 think they should because um\cb1 \
\cb3 the people that are around you that are\cb1 \
\cb3 in proximity to you matter\cb1 \
\cb3 um you you definitely reference a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 different data points\cb1 \
\cb3 that support and justify the notion that\cb1 \
\cb3 they should date out\cb1 \
\cb3 um however i guess\cb1 \
\cb3 some women that missed their mark if\cb1 \
\cb3 they tried to date men\cb1 \
\cb3 that were like the concentration of i\cb1 \
\cb3 guess high value man or\cb1 \
\cb3 henry's or hit squad man\cb1 \
\cb3 if the concentration of those men are\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 i guess high um sometimes and then and\cb1 \
\cb3 then also when you don't grow up with a\cb1 \
\cb3 father\cb1 \
\cb3 or someone to help you vet then there\cb1 \
\cb3 also is a factor that can go\cb1 \
\cb3 against you like your family and your\cb1 \
\cb3 background\cb1 \
\cb3 so me in my case i don't you know\cb1 \
\cb3 have children or you know things like\cb1 \
\cb3 that i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 i know what i need to work on i know\cb1 \
\cb3 where i rank okay um\cb1 \
\cb3 however um i would say like when i was\cb1 \
\cb3 21\cb1 \
\cb3 i dated you know i thought i dated\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty well to do brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 um that i felt that were going places i\cb1 \
\cb3 really\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't want to date older but i realized\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 that probably was a solution that i had\cb1 \
\cb3 to go to\cb1 \
\cb3 because of the men that were in\cb1 \
\cb3 proximity to me\cb1 \
\cb3 the people who i was exposed to so\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i experienced some younger men\cb1 \
\cb3 that wasted my time\cb1 \
\cb3 um and and i really didn't understand i\cb1 \
\cb3 guess\cb1 \
\cb3 what mayor wanted i guess because i was\cb1 \
\cb3 really\cb1 \
\cb3 into fitness and um the fbi\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i was really into that however\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the men that were in proximity\cb1 \
\cb3 to me\cb1 \
\cb3 they do value thick\cb1 \
\cb3 women like the more ratchet like i see a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot of ratchet\cb1 \
\cb3 women honestly like i see a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 ratchet women\cb1 \
\cb3 um but that's not what so if that's not\cb1 \
\cb3 if that's not what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 well proximity does matter i think\cb1 \
\cb3 more i think something that matters more\cb1 \
\cb3 than anything else is just\cb1 \
\cb3 awareness we have gotten so far to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point\cb1 \
\cb3 where we it has been become so skewed\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 thick and fine and edited all this other\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff to where women\cb1 \
\cb3 uh honestly cannot be allowed to kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 go astray which we got to kind of pull\cb1 \
\cb3 this thing back on track and say it is\cb1 \
\cb3 important\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the thing it's not just about\cb1 \
\cb3 being rich\cb1 \
\cb3 or high value i'm talking about men who\cb1 \
\cb3 are just above average earners\cb1 \
\cb3 right you know regular blue collar guys\cb1 \
\cb3 white collar guys we're not asking for\cb1 \
\cb3 masters of universe\cb1 \
\cb3 and that and when i say that\cb1 \
\cb3 they just want women who are fit and and\cb1 \
\cb3 and cooperative that's that's that's\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a new thing to hear for a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 women so\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's you know important for\cb1 \
\cb3 women to hear this\cb1 \
\cb3 because i would tell you this most men\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want to marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 black men in mass would prefer to be\cb1 \
\cb3 with black women see that's what i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to get lost that they\cb1 \
\cb3 you know like uh the guy who came on\cb1 \
\cb3 earlier to talk to his sister he came to\cb1 \
\cb3 her kind of like\cb1 \
\cb3 messed up about it because brothers\cb1 \
\cb3 would prefer to be with sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 i i gotta get on to the next call look\cb1 \
\cb3 we're getting getting late sis\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate it\cb1 \
\cb3 all right no problem yeah i want to get\cb1 \
\cb3 clear ladies that i'm not saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 hey you need to be successful\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive married brothers want to be\cb1 \
\cb3 with sisters\cb1 \
\cb3 but are you giving them what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 you got to give men what they want just\cb1 \
\cb3 like men got to give women what they\cb1 \
\cb3 want\cb1 \
\cb3 uh unmute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 2 2 9 whatever this is\cb1 \
\cb3 uh mute yourself hello\cb1 \
\cb3 first name\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you need to mute the youtube channel\cb1 \
\cb3 in the background\cb1 \
\cb3 you're drunk\cb1 \
\cb3 or successful competitive men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 well yes i i believe so of course um\cb1 \
\cb3 and then again the lady that called\cb1 \
\cb3 before her just got off the phone\cb1 \
\cb3 i was like like men\cb1 \
\cb3 black men need to stay with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 you know that was my point of it\cb1 \
\cb3 they need to stay with black women\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i think black people you still have\cb1 \
\cb3 youtube playing in the background\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you got to turn it off i got to go\cb1 \
\cb3 into the next call cause it's it's\cb1 \
\cb3 give me five wait i got something to\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you is very important but no you\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta turn that off\cb1 \
\cb3 oh well this lady you know this thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm just oh well me now\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm told you gotta turn out\cb1 \
\cb3 301\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 right your first name tiffany\cb1 \
\cb3 should successful competitive or high\cb1 \
\cb3 value men\cb1 \
\cb3 marry out that's the question on the\cb1 \
\cb3 table you got\cb1 \
\cb3 now is this um generally speaking like\cb1 \
\cb3 all men or is it just black men\cb1 \
\cb3 well black men is where the subject\cb1 \
\cb3 matter is so\cb1 \
\cb3 stick with black men go ahead um i think\cb1 \
\cb3 they should but equally i think\cb1 \
\cb3 black women who are high value as well\cb1 \
\cb3 should date out\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right um why did you feel the\cb1 \
\cb3 need to inject that part\cb1 \
\cb3 well because it's like if high value\cb1 \
\cb3 black men are going to date out\cb1 \
\cb3 then what's left for high value black\cb1 \
\cb3 women well\cb1 \
\cb3 let me stop you let me stop you right\cb1 \
\cb3 let me answer the question first of\cb1 \
\cb3 those two things those two things aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 equal\cb1 \
\cb3 because last night i had a show it says\cb1 \
\cb3 do women really have the options they\cb1 \
\cb3 think they have\cb1 \
\cb3 and most women feel like they're high\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would tell you this most women who\cb1 \
\cb3 think they're high value are not\cb1 \
\cb3 and even if they are they don't have the\cb1 \
\cb3 options they believe they have\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's not a one-to-one relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not like you have ten high-value\cb1 \
\cb3 black\cb1 \
\cb3 men 10 high-value uh black women\cb1 \
\cb3 and 10 high-value black men marry out\cb1 \
\cb3 and 10 high-value\cb1 \
\cb3 black women marry out that's not the\cb1 \
\cb3 numbers it doesn't work that way\cb1 \
\cb3 well i think that's a matter of opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 no it's not a matter of opinion it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact\cb1 \
\cb3 the numbers say it is\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean again i think it's a matter of\cb1 \
\cb3 opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 and if black high value men want to date\cb1 \
\cb3 out\cb1 \
\cb3 want to marry out it's marrying him\cb1 \
\cb3 marrying out\cb1 \
\cb3 if they want to marry out if they want\cb1 \
\cb3 to marry out then they\cb1 \
\cb3 should they they should do whatever they\cb1 \
\cb3 feel whatever makes them happy\cb1 \
\cb3 okay but you wanted to bring in you\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to bring in the women part though\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what you want to do\cb1 \
\cb3 why because well the thing is but when\cb1 \
\cb3 they think but hold on but you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't have the conversation but you\cb1 \
\cb3 seem to believe that\cb1 \
\cb3 a black woman who what makes a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman high value in your opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 um her background her level of education\cb1 \
\cb3 her health her mentally and physically\cb1 \
\cb3 i think that's what makes a high value\cb1 \
\cb3 women um\cb1 \
\cb3 i am that's all i am i'm educated\cb1 \
\cb3 that's all i like again that's all i\cb1 \
\cb3 like i am five i am five four\cb1 \
\cb3 dress size say that\cb1 \
\cb3 your dress size my dress size i wear a\cb1 \
\cb3 size 6.\cb1 \
\cb3 okay how much did you weigh the last\cb1 \
\cb3 time you weighed yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 i weigh 135. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 uh do most black so do what percentage\cb1 \
\cb3 of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 uh way what you weigh or less\cb1 \
\cb3 well i would have to check that but i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have that data in front just guess\cb1 \
\cb3 out of 100 like at least out of 100\cb1 \
\cb3 i would say probably um\cb1 \
\cb3 30 to 40 percent we come in different\cb1 \
\cb3 shapes and sizes no\cb1 \
\cb3 less than 20 percent 80 percent okay\cb1 \
\cb3 80 80 of black women are overweight and\cb1 \
\cb3 obese and there's one thing that is no\cb1 \
\cb3 the higher up\cb1 \
\cb3 women go in education and income the\cb1 \
\cb3 weight\cb1 \
\cb3 tends to increase as well well do you\cb1 \
\cb3 include the percentage of obesity\cb1 \
\cb3 amongst white women\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't care we're not we're only\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about black no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on hold on hold on ma'am i'm taking\cb1 \
\cb3 the conversation is you you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 shift it to white women when it suits\cb1 \
\cb3 you see if you want to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 high-value black women\cb1 \
\cb3 have options to marry out then i need to\cb1 \
\cb3 then where are they high about where are\cb1 \
\cb3 these high value black women's\cb1 \
\cb3 weddings because there are lots of\cb1 \
\cb3 channels talking about they're just your\cb1 \
\cb3 mating and dating\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't see any of these women\cb1 \
\cb3 with men\cb1 \
\cb3 well may i speak yes\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's very aggressive just to\cb1 \
\cb3 isolate black women\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't see what you're not going to do\cb1 \
\cb3 this thing aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't play these word games man it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 man's talk show i've allowed you to\cb1 \
\cb3 speak\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not going to use the shaming\cb1 \
\cb3 language here ma'am i speak in facts\cb1 \
\cb3 not shaming i think i think it's very\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressive\cb1 \
\cb3 and black women no it's not a thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know where you think that works\cb1 \
\cb3 but let's try this again like i said\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not going to overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 so if you want to have the conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 you can have the conversation but i will\cb1 \
\cb3 aggressively mute you if you try to\cb1 \
\cb3 overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 are we clear\cb1 \
\cb3 did you hear what i did i didn't i just\cb1 \
\cb3 said\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want me i'm saying i'm running\cb1 \
\cb3 a talk show man and when i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 and talking it's bad for the viewers\cb1 \
\cb3 so respect when i start speaking it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not like having a conversation in person\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm running a show\cb1 \
\cb3 so it's not being aggressive see that\cb1 \
\cb3 that kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 anyway i don't want to go down that path\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 how old are you i'm actually\cb1 \
\cb3 27 27 what's your husband's name\cb1 \
\cb3 my husband i'm not married yet but i do\cb1 \
\cb3 i am in a relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how long have you guys been engaged\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 for like three months now\cb1 \
\cb3 three months congratulations yeah what\cb1 \
\cb3 do you propose to you thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 when did he propose well we were\cb1 \
\cb3 actually at a\cb1 \
\cb3 we were actually at a family gathering\cb1 \
\cb3 when he did it\cb1 \
\cb3 so you know it's kind of like coded\cb1 \
\cb3 so he can't do it so what are you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 planning on when is the wedding date\cb1 \
\cb3 well we're trying to shoot for next year\cb1 \
\cb3 but it\cb1 \
\cb3 all depends on the whole covet thing but\cb1 \
\cb3 he's actually\cb1 \
\cb3 not american okay and what does it what\cb1 \
\cb3 does your husband do\cb1 \

\cb3 percentage of black women have the same\cb1 \
\cb3 experience that you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot i just don't think a lot of this\cb1 \
\cb3 no ma'am you can't just\cb1 \
\cb3 no no see what no now see we were doing\cb1 \
\cb3 so well\cb1 \
\cb3 until you came out with this a lot but\cb1 \
\cb3 it's just not publicized\cb1 \
\cb3 yes there's a secret underground\cb1 \
\cb3 movement\cb1 \
\cb3 to keep high-value black women who are\cb1 \
\cb3 successfully marrying out\cb1 \
\cb3 a closely guarded state secret\cb1 \
\cb3 it is getting up get\cb1 \

\cb3 uh it's all good i know many people have\cb1 \
\cb3 grown to like it\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm gonna tell you this we have\cb1 \
\cb3 grown this trailer we've grown this\cb1 \
\cb3 platform we've grown this movement\cb1 \
\cb3 because if nothing else we have become\cb1 \
\cb3 to start having conversations that are\cb1 \
\cb3 not happening\cb1 \
\cb3 other places um yes i've realized that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know high value this or high value\cb1 \
\cb3 that has\cb1 \
\cb3 taken you know on a life of its own and\cb1 \
\cb3 i will be responding to some of my\cb1 \
\cb3 latest high value critics\cb1 \
\cb3 even though you know i endeavor to stay\cb1 \
\cb3 out of beefs and squabbles\cb1 \
\cb3 and back and forth but you know good\cb1 \
\cb3 people can disagree\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's how you disagree that matters a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot as a\cb1 \
\cb3 man especially a man of value enough\cb1 \
\cb3 substance\cb1 \
\cb3 more on that later you see the title in\cb1 \
\cb3 the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 you see the title of the video she still\cb1 \
\cb3 thinks she's the schnitz\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah we got a lot of noise going on over\cb1 \
\cb3 here guys you know\cb1 \
\cb3 uh la is about to go on another um\cb1 \
\cb3 curfew so people are getting all their\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 in and i ain't mad at them by the time\cb1 \
\cb3 they go on curfew\cb1 \
\cb3 i would be up out of this piece uh so i\cb1 \
\cb3 think a lot of folks are just kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 doing what they do so that's what about\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on just a second\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so well we're not going to\cb1 \
\cb3 worry about it\cb1 \
\cb3 as la is about to go on la uh curfew\cb1 \
\cb3 on saturday la is\cb1 \
\cb3 been a great trip but i realized that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm much more of a new york city guy\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm much more of a coast guard uh but\cb1 \
\cb3 why do i want to do this show today\cb1 \
\cb3 why do i want to do this show today baby\cb1 \
\cb3 mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 who still think they're the stuff and i\cb1 \
\cb3 need to speak\cb1 \
\cb3 about a particular subset of women\cb1 \
\cb3 they fall into that adjustable six\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh closer to the eight ver the\cb1 \
\cb3 closer to the eight\cb1 \
\cb3 range of the adjustable six not closer\cb1 \
\cb3 to the six range\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable six for those of you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know when i\cb1 \
\cb3 uh rank people rate women i don't use\cb1 \
\cb3 sevens because\cb1 \
\cb3 my reasons you're either a six which is\cb1 \
\cb3 cute\cb1 \
\cb3 or you're an eight which is pretty seven\cb1 \
\cb3 allows too much gray area for many\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 and an adjustable six is a woman who is\cb1 \
\cb3 walks around and she's cute and on any\cb1 \
\cb3 given sunday she can decide that she\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to be pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 and all she has to do is put some you\cb1 \
\cb3 know do yourself up\cb1 \
\cb3 as it were adjustable sixes\cb1 \
\cb3 eights nines and tens that's who we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to talk about today\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable sixes eights nines and tens\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the women who get a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 they're used to getting attention\cb1 \
\cb3 they're used to having getting their\cb1 \
\cb3 pick of the litter they're used to guys\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to highlight them try to record\cb1 \
\cb3 them because they look good\cb1 \
\cb3 and it has always been that way even\cb1 \
\cb3 before social media\cb1 \
\cb3 it has been that way okay\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the these are the women who were\cb1 \
\cb3 like the head cheerleader\cb1 \
\cb3 the it girl all those women\cb1 \
\cb3 and her posse that she hung with we're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about women\cb1 \
\cb3 that even if you had to play the wingman\cb1 \
\cb3 you still weren't coming up short\cb1 \
\cb3 by hollandaise vanessa you know\cb1 \
\cb3 there was cheryl there's joanne there's\cb1 \
\cb3 shelly\cb1 \
\cb3 there's vanessa and then there's sheila\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody wants sheila oh she loves\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody wanted sheila [ __ ] it was a\cb1 \
\cb3 bad one\cb1 \
\cb3 and only certain kind of men could\cb1 \
\cb3 get the sheilas of the world but\cb1 \
\cb3 if you happen to get her cousin or her\cb1 \
\cb3 friend vanessa\cb1 \
\cb3 vanessa was no slouch\cb1 \
\cb3 and often vanessa wins more than sheila\cb1 \
\cb3 because vanessa had to work harder\cb1 \
\cb3 but here's what we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 women who are adjustable sixes\cb1 \
\cb3 at least cute we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 thelma on good times range\cb1 \
\cb3 to beyonce to to kelly rowland\cb1 \
\cb3 up to halle berry or old school vanessa\cb1 \
\cb3 williams i watched hoodlum the other day\cb1 \
\cb3 throwback movie and god dog vanessa\cb1 \
\cb3 williams was whoo-hoo\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] burger that woman was so fine back\cb1 \
\cb3 in the whoo\cb1 \

\cb3 okay we know the class of when we're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about cute\cb1 \
\cb3 nice body you know dress size 6 or under\cb1 \
\cb3 fit tone just bad\cb1 \
\cb3 bad cute pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful or gorgeous but what ends up\cb1 \
\cb3 happening\cb1 \
\cb3 what ends up happening somewhere along\cb1 \
\cb3 the way\cb1 \
\cb3 let's talk about it there's hillary\cb1 \
\cb3 that's like sheila\cb1 \
\cb3 there's tina and there's angie angie\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't in this group\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the tinas of the worlds the\cb1 \
\cb3 tinas and the tiffany's\cb1 \
\cb3 tina's and tiffany's could have went\cb1 \
\cb3 either way but somewhere along the way\cb1 \
\cb3 tina decided to start dealing with bums\cb1 \
\cb3 losers deadbeats guys who were not\cb1 \
\cb3 on her level\cb1 \
\cb3 and he may have put it on her whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 the guy she chose to kick it with\cb1 \
\cb3 she just threw caution to the wind and\cb1 \
\cb3 allowed him to go in there\cb1 \
\cb3 raw and shooting up the club\cb1 \
\cb3 can count and what ends up happening\cb1 \
\cb3 here comes\cb1 \
\cb3 tiffany or tina and they're pregnant\cb1 \

\cb3 pregnant before 25\cb1 \

\cb3 whatever whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 and like everything else it falls apart\cb1 \
\cb3 they got one kid by the dude two kids by\cb1 \
\cb3 the dude\cb1 \

\cb3 and then they run back out here and\cb1 \
\cb3 think that well you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm tiffany i'm tina\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm still i'm still pretty i'm still the\cb1 \

\cb3 six or seven years but you weren't his\cb1 \
\cb3 wife\cb1 \

\cb3 and this happens a lot to your\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable sixes\cb1 \
\cb3 sevens your adjustable sixes eights\cb1 \
\cb3 nines and tens\cb1 \
\cb3 because you're used to going through\cb1 \
\cb3 life on your looks\cb1 \
\cb3 your looks open doors you don't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 get things in writing or\cb1 \
\cb3 contractually because you assume the\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty is going to last forever\cb1 \
\cb3 and that as long as you stay pretty and\cb1 \
\cb3 in shape\cb1 \
\cb3 you'll still be that hot little thing\cb1 \

\cb3 man for six or seven years\cb1 \

\cb3 woman can give any man on the planet\cb1 \
\cb3 you gave him children you gave him not\cb1 \
\cb3 only one you gave him two\cb1 \
\cb3 and yet you did not require him to even\cb1 \
\cb3 bestow the title of a\cb1 \
\cb3 wife upon you so you go back out into\cb1 \
\cb3 the market\cb1 \
\cb3 older with two children\cb1 \
\cb3 you and you expect someone in that\cb1 \
\cb3 market\cb1 \
\cb3 to accept you older and bestow the title\cb1 \
\cb3 of wife upon you\cb1 \

\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies like it or not you outnumber us\cb1 \
\cb3 you there are physically more women\cb1 \
\cb3 than men and you cannot afford to be\cb1 \
\cb3 like some of the women who have called\cb1 \
\cb3 my show\cb1 \
\cb3 addressed size 16 18 or 20 asking about\cb1 \
\cb3 the problems with men\cb1 \
\cb3 when multiple children by multiple\cb1 \
\cb3 different by\cb1 \
\cb3 by one or two or three dudes look\cb1 \
\cb3 these things cost you and to think you\cb1 \
\cb3 can in thinking that just because you\cb1 \
\cb3 are still cute pretty or beautiful or\cb1 \
\cb3 gorgeous\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking you're still the ish as a baby\cb1 \
\cb3 mama\cb1 \
\cb3 reality's going to tell you something\cb1 \
\cb3 different\cb1 \
\cb3 no see this is how we judge over here we\cb1 \
\cb3 don't judge\cb1 \
\cb3 by dealing with dating we judging\cb1 \
\cb3 weddings\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the only thing that counts if\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not married you're losing\cb1 \
\cb3 see that makes it real clear because\cb1 \
\cb3 you've had\cb1 \
\cb3 everything up to that point anyway right\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been engaged right i don't count\cb1 \
\cb3 those either\cb1 \
\cb3 been engaged remember we don't count\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with remember one of the best\cb1 \
\cb3 things i ever gave you guys and when you\cb1 \
\cb3 latest we don't deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with can deal with can deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 engagements pretty women\cb1 \
\cb3 are some of the most engaged unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty sadly\cb1 \
\cb3 cute pretty beautiful african-american\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 tend to be some of the prettiest\cb1 \
\cb3 engaged but unwifed women\cb1 \
\cb3 more on that later because women\cb1 \
\cb3 especially a lot of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 have been engaged for a long time three\cb1 \
\cb3 four five engagements see when you make\cb1 \
\cb3 it real clear\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a high value man or whatever you\cb1 \
\cb3 do whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 term you're using has any one of them\cb1 \
\cb3 marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the answer is no\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's what i say it's the dating\cb1 \
\cb3 market is difficult because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not an unattractive woman sure a\cb1 \
\cb3 guy will take you out for a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice date\cb1 \
\cb3 you really know what you really want to\cb1 \
\cb3 know what you think\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 get my lights up\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 uh we got 200 300 more to go\cb1 \
\cb3 300 more to go\cb1 \
\cb3 it should be at least 1700\cb1 \
\cb3 we will go to round two if we need to\cb1 \
\cb3 guys\cb1 \

\cb3 doing it\cb1 \
\cb3 five six i weigh 115 pounds yes oh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll take you out i'll tell you i would\cb1 \
\cb3 take you\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i don't have a problem finding men of\cb1 \
\cb3 course not i wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is but what do you find in\cb1 \
\cb3 the four though\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and this is where the disconnect\cb1 \
\cb3 tends to be\cb1 \
\cb3 i never probably find him in depending\cb1 \
\cb3 on the date yeah but the only thing\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing that men will take you out for\cb1 \
\cb3 with your cute self\cb1 \
\cb3 is sex\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what the caller was saying why\cb1 \
\cb3 all the good men it we're all the men\cb1 \
\cb3 who want relationships in marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't get them because you chose to\cb1 \
\cb3 have a baby before you got married for\cb1 \
\cb3 one\cb1 \
\cb3 two different times and you are still\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to date\cb1 \
\cb3 based on your looks thinking you're\cb1 \
\cb3 still the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're not those children\cb1 \
\cb3 cost you but you can't tell a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 baby mamas especially\cb1 \
\cb3 women that remember the days where they\cb1 \
\cb3 got into vip for free\cb1 \
\cb3 the days where they were getting fluid\cb1 \
\cb3 out and everything else they think that\cb1 \
\cb3 this will happen so often with\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable sixes and eights even let's\cb1 \
\cb3 get let's get it right out to the eights\cb1 \
\cb3 and nines\cb1 \
\cb3 eights nines and tens who used to be the\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 you are no longer this you are no longer\cb1 \
\cb3 the stuff after you have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're still trying to get out here\cb1 \
\cb3 and date and negotiate\cb1 \
\cb3 as if you're still hot stuff and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll take you out take you out get you a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice steak and some lobster\cb1 \
\cb3 we'd have a good old time and i would\cb1 \
\cb3 blow your\cb1 \
\cb3 back out but i wouldn't marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 see now i want to be clear i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 to this person\cb1 \
\cb3 because she's asking a question and\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to help you lady\cb1 \
\cb3 that's i'm not speaking for me i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 speaking for men in general\cb1 \
\cb3 wait to how you see how this story ends\cb1 \
\cb3 because a lot i had many women saying oh\cb1 \
\cb3 you were so mean to her\cb1 \
\cb3 you were so that was so harsh she's so\cb1 \
\cb3 misunderstood\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i never do anything without\cb1 \
\cb3 having a reason\cb1 \
\cb3 and the point was ma'am you don't seem\cb1 \
\cb3 to get it\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids means you can't get what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't get what you used to get\cb1 \
\cb3 what i think i really have an issue is\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 finding men that don't want like the\cb1 \
\cb3 superficial like most i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 the type of guys like they just want a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman that like\cb1 \
\cb3 looks good on their arm like yes\cb1 \
\cb3 now remember this part too this is a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who came in\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a mother of two kids and i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 career woman and my kids are beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 and gorgeous and well-behaved and\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want a man who's just into this\cb1 \
\cb3 petty superficial stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 oh you can't make this stuff up i want\cb1 \
\cb3 more\cb1 \
\cb3 i want hmm\cb1 \
\cb3 oh you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 so like when you don't listen let me\cb1 \
\cb3 stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop\cb1 \
\cb3 stop right there yes that's what we want\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's who we are\cb1 \
\cb3 and you want a man that's the problem i\cb1 \
\cb3 have with david but listen listen listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen yeah the problem she has with\cb1 \
\cb3 dating is the men want beautiful women\cb1 \
\cb3 who don't have children\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem and again right thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 roxy sin\cb1 \
\cb3 riding on the pretty here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 you wasted pretty babe\cb1 \
\cb3 you wasted it pretty and as i said\cb1 \
\cb3 further it ain't just a pro\cb1 \
\cb3 it ain't just the men aren't the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 look at how many women call into this\cb1 \
\cb3 show trying to understand what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on with men and why are men\cb1 \
\cb3 no ma'am more you ladies need take\cb1 \
\cb3 accountability be honest with yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 and accept what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 you want men not to be men you want men\cb1 \
\cb3 to think\cb1 \
\cb3 like women that's not what we value\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 we want a beautiful woman on our arm\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah that's the problem well\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 yes did you hear this woman\cb1 \
\cb3 we want a woman a beautiful woman on her\cb1 \
\cb3 arm\cb1 \
\cb3 and she actually had the nerve to say\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 so guess what to the men of the world\cb1 \
\cb3 all 3.5 billion of you you're the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem\cb1 \
\cb3 not her not a woman who not women who\cb1 \
\cb3 decide to go out and do what they do\cb1 \
\cb3 fine you can do that\cb1 \
\cb3 but then you want to come back and judge\cb1 \
\cb3 you for wanting what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 why because pretty privilege is the\cb1 \
\cb3 business\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty pretty baby mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 are a special breed because they really\cb1 \
\cb3 still think they are the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 you're the problem because i'm telling\cb1 \
\cb3 you what men\cb1 \
\cb3 want you've experienced what men want\cb1 \
\cb3 and you've got a problem with it that's\cb1 \
\cb3 your problem we're not going to change\cb1 \
\cb3 you're either going to get on board with\cb1 \
\cb3 it or you will die alone\cb1 \
\cb3 so what should i be looking for then\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly first you need to get down and\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 you have no leverage you have no\cb1 \
\cb3 leverage in this matter\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the men we control access to\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships you control access to sex\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to understand what a man that\cb1 \
\cb3 you would want\cb1 \
\cb3 what he would want in a girlfriend wife\cb1 \
\cb3 or significant other\cb1 \
\cb3 like a good like a good mother\cb1 \
\cb3 that changes from every man that changes\cb1 \
\cb3 from man to man\cb1 \
\cb3 where's your father oh i don't i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't grow up with a mother or a\cb1 \
\cb3 father all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 due respect you you you've you you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 derek if that is you in the chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 because the avatar looks like yours but\cb1 \
\cb3 there's no check mark\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking me how is she the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 sit back and listen to the video but\cb1 \
\cb3 there's an entire video\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yeah i don't know if this is really\cb1 \
\cb3 your account or not\cb1 \
\cb3 how is she the problem though pay\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't seem to get that\cb1 \
\cb3 men judge the way we judge and yes like\cb1 \
\cb3 i said you have no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 getting men to pay you attention you've\cb1 \
\cb3 got no\cb1 \
\cb3 problem attracting men but getting a man\cb1 \
\cb3 to take you\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously and would you like to be\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 would okay and that's a problem because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking a man to become a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking let's say you're asking me\cb1 \
\cb3 to come in and take care of one man's\cb1 \
\cb3 child\cb1 \
\cb3 a man's two children\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't create those it's all downside\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been a stepfather it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 horrible deal what about the men that\cb1 \
\cb3 have children of their own\cb1 \
\cb3 they want a stepmother\cb1 \
\cb3 well again you still act as though\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 listening okay listen i'll answer it\cb1 \
\cb3 see you still you're still speaking as\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have leverage in this thing\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm trying to level set you\cb1 \
\cb3 even if i have children i got more\cb1 \
\cb3 options than you\cb1 \
\cb3 i can go find a woman with no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 because i can afford both of you\cb1 \
\cb3 if i can afford if i can afford to take\cb1 \
\cb3 care of you and your\cb1 \
\cb3 patrol account or not how is she the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 is walking out into a dating market\cb1 \
\cb3 blaming men for wanting what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 see we are all\cb1 \
\cb3 we have far too many people telling\cb1 \
\cb3 women you can have your standards girl\cb1 \
\cb3 have your standards set your standards\cb1 \
\cb3 high you can be a queen\cb1 \
\cb3 this that such and so forth and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 fine guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 men have them too and we don't tell the\cb1 \
\cb3 complete story\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem because you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman out here with one\cb1 \
\cb3 two children faulting men\cb1 \
\cb3 for having standards faulty men for\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet they can they can want whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 they want from me and if you pay\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 you will hear this woman go into how she\cb1 \
\cb3 wants\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 kids i can afford to take care of her\cb1 \
\cb3 and no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah why would i pick you and your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 when i know your kids are\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to i'm not their father\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll never look at me as their father\cb1 \
\cb3 i got all the responsibility and none of\cb1 \
\cb3 the upside of being a biological father\cb1 \
\cb3 can i discipline those children like\cb1 \
\cb3 they were my own\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't need to discipline their\cb1 \
\cb3 brains i see that's your pro\cb1 \
\cb3 problem number one she's got kids that\cb1 \
\cb3 she doesn't want anybody to discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 because they don't need discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem now\cb1 \
\cb3 because i happen to be really good at\cb1 \
\cb3 what i do\cb1 \
\cb3 and i do this in real life because i do\cb1 \
\cb3 go back and forth to people\cb1 \
\cb3 in real time every night i'm pretty good\cb1 \
\cb3 at analyzing reading and adjusting\cb1 \
\cb3 so maybe i don't know everything but i\cb1 \
\cb3 see a pattern\cb1 \
\cb3 an entitled self-absorbed person who\cb1 \
\cb3 wants what she wants\cb1 \
\cb3 but doesn't want people to want what\cb1 \
\cb3 they want i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem and we need to start\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women it's a problem because men\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't accepting it\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not a problem then why didn't she\cb1 \
\cb3 marry the guy that she had won two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem we act as though what\cb1 \
\cb3 women can do with anything they want to\cb1 \
\cb3 and no one's supposed to say anything\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you do you're toxic\cb1 \
\cb3 you're build your bullying your your\cb1 \
\cb3 your toxic masculine that is bs\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women there's no fault in the\cb1 \
\cb3 things they do does not\cb1 \
\cb3 help women i have women here call every\cb1 \
\cb3 night say you know when i first started\cb1 \
\cb3 listening i didn't like you\cb1 \
\cb3 but now i'm a better wife i'm a better\cb1 \
\cb3 mother\cb1 \
\cb3 go through my catalog i stand by my work\cb1 \
\cb3 because it happens every day monday\cb1 \
\cb3 through friday\cb1 \
\cb3 live you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 um there you go right there she said\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't need this\cb1 \
\cb3 okay this is why this is why shh\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't think children your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 are not special\cb1 \
\cb3 they need discipline just like anyone\cb1 \
\cb3 else maybe you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't okay then this is the problem i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need they don't need discipline so\cb1 \
\cb3 the answer is\cb1 \
\cb3 could i could i discipline the child\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 okay without without quit without you\cb1 \
\cb3 questioning me\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah if i'm like if i choose you as my\cb1 \
\cb3 partner like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm have complete trust in you okay so i\cb1 \
\cb3 got so i could so i could spank the\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 attend they don't need spain no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 i\cb1 \
\cb3 could spend you see how that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 how she's\cb1 \
\cb3 quickly say yes you can just if i choose\cb1 \
\cb3 you of my partner as\cb1 \
\cb3 being of dual minds saying stuff that\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't mean is a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 because if a man says something he\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't believe we call him a liar\cb1 \
\cb3 we call him unstable foundation unset\cb1 \
\cb3 we're talking about a woman with one two\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 i expect women to be what they say they\cb1 \
\cb3 are\cb1 \
\cb3 adults did see\cb1 \
\cb3 see right there i said i can discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 children you said yes\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention to woman i am\cb1 \
\cb3 you said i could discipline the children\cb1 \
\cb3 without you questioning me\cb1 \
\cb3 yes so if i decide to spank them i gotta\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to your mouth\cb1 \
\cb3 cause they don't need it that's why you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to stay single until your kids are\cb1 \
\cb3 gone\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the choice you made when you\cb1 \
\cb3 reproduced ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 and and i have a question why don't more\cb1 \
\cb3 of you why don't more people tell women\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 you decided you chose no child gets born\cb1 \
\cb3 in 2000\cb1 \
\cb3 no child gets born today that was not\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning there are too many forms of\cb1 \
\cb3 birth control prior to conception and\cb1 \
\cb3 too many options post conception\cb1 \
\cb3 no woman is forced to have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 so i don't give women outs for choosing\cb1 \
\cb3 when a life is born and when you choose\cb1 \
\cb3 that you choose everything that comes\cb1 \
\cb3 along with it but not enough people tell\cb1 \
\cb3 women that guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 you choosing to do that is fine but you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't\cb1 \
\cb3 but you gonna either need to accept\cb1 \
\cb3 everything that comes along with it the\cb1 \
\cb3 ups and the downs\cb1 \
\cb3 especially if you're not gonna be\cb1 \
\cb3 married to the father\cb1 \
\cb3 and know that it's going to hurt you in\cb1 \
\cb3 the open dating market because no one\cb1 \
\cb3 the world doesn't owe you acceptance or\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 and if that's too much for you if you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want anybody to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cope don't want anybody to deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 your kids whatever then sit it out\cb1 \
\cb3 see we are good to tell men stay in your\cb1 \
\cb3 lane do better improve\cb1 \
\cb3 but guess what more we we are finally\cb1 \
\cb3 starting to have a conversation with\cb1 \
\cb3 women because what they're realizing\cb1 \
\cb3 is all this feel good prosperity\cb1 \
\cb3 preaching this\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't nothing wrong with you queen ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 working\cb1 \
\cb3 they look on their left finger and they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have a ring\cb1 \
\cb3 a wedding ring from a man of value that\cb1 \
\cb3 they respect\cb1 \
\cb3 it may feel good to hear it but it ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 getting them where they want\cb1 \
\cb3 i need you ladies to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something you going out here having\cb1 \
\cb3 babies without marriage and then\cb1 \
\cb3 breaking up with men\cb1 \
\cb3 you incur consequences we don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 those kids around us because we cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 take care of them\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot discipline them we don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 put up with all this other stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a fun woman guys look at you and\cb1 \
\cb3 be like she's got two kids and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 5 6 115 she's a lot of fun she's\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously sexually active i'll have a\cb1 \
\cb3 good time with you but no way\cb1 \
\cb3 not no not no way but very unlikely the\cb1 \
\cb3 man is going to take you seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 especially when you start talking\cb1 \
\cb3 so now for all the men\cb1 \
\cb3 recognize the truth of what i just said\cb1 \
\cb3 is you could be as pretty as you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 but talking about a man of consequence\cb1 \
\cb3 taking you seriously the chances are\cb1 \
\cb3 slim\cb1 \
\cb3 to none why is that such an\cb1 \
\cb3 issue telling women that you chose to be\cb1 \
\cb3 a mother once and twice\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 why is that such a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of saying well you know whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 queen\cb1 \
\cb3 you can do what you want queen because\cb1 \
\cb3 no one's marrying these queens\cb1 \
\cb3 when her lament off the rip but she\cb1 \
\cb3 can't find anyone\cb1 \
\cb3 of consequence to be serious with\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it gets better\cb1 \
\cb3 because i believe what you're telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 is honestly and i'm like who wants this\cb1 \
\cb3 deal\cb1 \
\cb3 who doesn't want this deal a beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that is a great mother has a great\cb1 \
\cb3 career\cb1 \
\cb3 um who doesn't want this deal listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 what she said this is her selling point\cb1 \
\cb3 a beautiful woman\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the next selling point a great\cb1 \
\cb3 mother we don't give a snot\cb1 \
\cb3 those aren't our kids ma'am being a\cb1 \
\cb3 great mother\cb1 \
\cb3 does not make you the stuff out here\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 the baby daddy didn't value it enough\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am or i should still be with him\cb1 \
\cb3 so if the man who shot up the club and\cb1 \
\cb3 gave you two children\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't value it enough to keep it why do\cb1 \
\cb3 you expect us to\cb1 \
\cb3 again she led with the beauty because\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what you got\cb1 \
\cb3 good for you but you're not still the\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 a beautiful a a a great mother which is\cb1 \
\cb3 subjective\cb1 \
\cb3 you can say you're a great mother uh i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 the jury's out on it but anybody who's\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about kids don't need\cb1 \
\cb3 disciplining\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want to be anywhere around those\cb1 \
\cb3 kids have you ever been around people\cb1 \
\cb3 who don't discipline their children\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't i don't know many men of\cb1 \
\cb3 consequence who want to deal with that\cb1 \
\cb3 then what is next thing she said i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 phd your career\cb1 \
\cb3 two of the three two of the three things\cb1 \
\cb3 she put out there\cb1 \
\cb3 as her selling points we don't give a\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] about\cb1 \
\cb3 oh don't care about don't care about\cb1 \
\cb3 your career strong\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm submissive nobody but listen\cb1 \
\cb3 did you\cb1 \
\cb3 did you hear what i just said did you\cb1 \
\cb3 just okay did you hear what i just said\cb1 \
\cb3 don't care about your career\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah the thing is ma'am it's the two\cb1 \
\cb3 kids\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the two remember she classified\cb1 \
\cb3 herself the strongest\cb1 \
\cb3 and not she's uh not strong but she's\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive remember that\cb1 \
\cb3 kids everything you're saying does not\cb1 \
\cb3 overcome the deficit that two children\cb1 \
\cb3 bring\cb1 \
\cb3 if you if i mean like you have money\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't matter to you\cb1 \
\cb3 i said you have money that doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 matter to you\cb1 \
\cb3 no your money doesn't matter to us\cb1 \
\cb3 because we don't have access to it get\cb1 \
\cb3 this through your head ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 your career does not matter to us\cb1 \
\cb3 not like you want it to your money\cb1 \
\cb3 does not matter to us because we don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have access to it\cb1 \
\cb3 i've talked i've tackled this many times\cb1 \
\cb3 before too\cb1 \
\cb3 remember the woman with the previous\cb1 \
\cb3 couple of weeks ago i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 calling in talking about her great\cb1 \
\cb3 career how much you ever spent on a guy\cb1 \
\cb3 six hundred dollars i bought him a bag\cb1 \
\cb3 six hundred dollars that's dinner\cb1 \
\cb3 the things you're trying to sell do not\cb1 \
\cb3 overcome\cb1 \
\cb3 the deficit of\cb1 \
\cb3 children if this were a math equation\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd have to balance it if it were a\cb1 \
\cb3 see-saw\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty education\cb1 \
\cb3 income even if we rated those things\cb1 \
\cb3 children boom\cb1 \
\cb3 how much would you have to put on this\cb1 \
\cb3 side to overcome\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 how much would you have to put over here\cb1 \
\cb3 to overcome two children\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can't discipline that she says\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 who have a father out there moving\cb1 \
\cb3 around doing something that's gonna have\cb1 \
\cb3 influence impact in your life\cb1 \

\cb3 connection\cb1 \
\cb3 you got connected your uterus was\cb1 \
\cb3 connected to\cb1 \
\cb3 another human being twice\cb1 \
\cb3 and it is time for men to start telling\cb1 \
\cb3 women and start for women start hearing\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 anybody that's telling you that having\cb1 \
\cb3 children doesn't affect your\cb1 \
\cb3 sexual marketplace value and the your\cb1 \
\cb3 your selling price is lying to you but i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women the truth is a difficult\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would rather tell the truth and\cb1 \
\cb3 have them having to\cb1 \
\cb3 make a choice other than filling their\cb1 \
\cb3 head up with stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 that ain't going to end up working\cb1 \
\cb3 because 30 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 she still thinks because she's pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 she's the snitch\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to what i'm saying is she talking\cb1 \
\cb3 like a woman who's had two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 who realizes the thing having these two\cb1 \
\cb3 kids out here on this open dating market\cb1 \
\cb3 in la\cb1 \
\cb3 is going to really really hurt my\cb1 \
\cb3 chances so i need to\cb1 \
\cb3 do something to compensate for my\cb1 \
\cb3 liabilities\cb1 \

\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i yeah i i always have options i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to how i always have options\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why you should be very careful\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with women with children\cb1 \
\cb3 especially pretty ones\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention gentlemen\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies this may not be you but it's\cb1 \
\cb3 likely one of your home girls\cb1 \
\cb3 ask you one more time and if you are\cb1 \
\cb3 vague i'm going to bid you a good night\cb1 \
\cb3 just asking you are you dating someone\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah how long have you guys been seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 one another\cb1 \
\cb3 um it's been like two years two\cb1 \
\cb3 years has he expressed\cb1 \
\cb3 any desire to make you his wife\cb1 \
\cb3 yes has he taken you ring shopping in\cb1 \
\cb3 the last\cb1 \
\cb3 two years now remember this woman came\cb1 \
\cb3 on here talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 dating in l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's claiming that she's had a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship with somebody for two years\cb1 \
\cb3 and the man wants to marry her if we\cb1 \
\cb3 flipped that\cb1 \
\cb3 and made it a man\cb1 \
\cb3 if we made her a man and made that a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman on the other end of two years\cb1 \
\cb3 what would we call him what would the\cb1 \
\cb3 world call him\cb1 \
\cb3 see no he'd be all kind of dogs all kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of he'd be all kind of pejoratives\cb1 \
\cb3 but yeah she's just as cowsy i got\cb1 \
\cb3 options and i got somebody who wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 marry me i've been doing one for two\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would rather get some oh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 how's she the problem really\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you not see this oh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i almost went there we've been ring\cb1 \
\cb3 shopping yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 when about three months ago\cb1 \
\cb3 three months ago she went ring shopping\cb1 \
\cb3 with him\cb1 \
\cb3 she allowed me to take her room shopping\cb1 \
\cb3 this ain't the guy that\cb1 \
\cb3 like really just like sparks like\cb1 \
\cb3 two years my i don't know it just\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 someone i want to be with forever so\cb1 \
\cb3 two years let him take a ring shopping\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously if you think he's not done\cb1 \
\cb3 something for her and her children\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd be foolish now\cb1 \
\cb3 who would say this woman would she i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a a great mother great career does\cb1 \
\cb3 she sound like the kind of person you'd\cb1 \
\cb3 want to deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 who would like to be the man who doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 she was on this podcast or this show\cb1 \
\cb3 who would like to be the guy she's\cb1 \
\cb3 texting hey hey big head hey good\cb1 \
\cb3 morning\cb1 \
\cb3 who would who would like to be that\cb1 \
\cb3 cluck\cb1 \
\cb3 that simp that lick\cb1 \
\cb3 that she's playing\cb1 \
\cb3 we see we have no problem when women do\cb1 \
\cb3 it to men\cb1 \
\cb3 oh but over here we call it out because\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make women perpetual victims\cb1 \
\cb3 for choices they make\cb1 \
\cb3 but you're asking what the problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 so i go back to the first thing i asked\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 are you telling me you are seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 someone then they're the man who's\cb1 \
\cb3 actually\cb1 \
\cb3 considering you is the man you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be with\cb1 \
\cb3 and you said i've got options and you\cb1 \
\cb3 just went through this\cb1 \
\cb3 convoluted way of getting back down to i\cb1 \
\cb3 got somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 playing my love life well well no ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 what it is is it's hard for you to deal\cb1 \
\cb3 with the truth what it is is\cb1 \
\cb3 one you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that you want considering you\cb1 \
\cb3 to be his wife you got\cb1 \
\cb3 hard to explain her love life no no it's\cb1 \
\cb3 really not\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to explain it really easily\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not the [ __ ] you still think you\cb1 \
\cb3 are but you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have yet to reconcile that and\cb1 \
\cb3 come to reality\cb1 \
\cb3 you're still walking around here\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking you're the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 man that you don't want who sounds like\cb1 \
\cb3 he would take you\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't want to marry him that's\cb1 \
\cb3 why it's been two years\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why you're on here trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 figure it out and i'm only trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 help you but it seems like you'd rather\cb1 \
\cb3 argue or be right than listen no i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to argue\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well then i need you to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that your children are a massive\cb1 \
\cb3 impediment\cb1 \
\cb3 how about this would you like to have\cb1 \
\cb3 additional children i\cb1 \
\cb3 would how many oh\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe two one to two so let's say you\cb1 \
\cb3 and i were to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 okay what you automatically set up\cb1 \
\cb3 is you get pregnant on our wedding night\cb1 \
\cb3 and you get preg and you give birth to\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin junior\cb1 \
\cb3 then a year or a year after that you\cb1 \
\cb3 give birth to\cb1 \
\cb3 kim kevin and kim are my biological\cb1 \
\cb3 children with you right\cb1 \
\cb3 okay then i still have to take care of\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 two other children right so we have four\cb1 \
\cb3 four kids in the house yeah kevin and\cb1 \
\cb3 kim\cb1 \
\cb3 are mine if i decide to spank kevin you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't say [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 to me because he's mine biologically you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't tell me\cb1 \
\cb3 listen okay you're going to sit there\cb1 \
\cb3 and zip your mouth and let me get\cb1 \
\cb3 through the example before you say\cb1 \
\cb3 something can you do that give me a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin and cam are mine they're my\cb1 \
\cb3 financial responsibility and you cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 pull the mommy card on me because\cb1 \
\cb3 biologically you can't you can't one-up\cb1 \
\cb3 me you can't play the high joker\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't say these um those aren't but\cb1 \
\cb3 when it comes to your children\cb1 \
\cb3 they're your children i've got to\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline them\cb1 \
\cb3 in line with what you think is right so\cb1 \
\cb3 i got\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids two sets of kids in the house\cb1 \
\cb3 under two sets of rules\cb1 \
\cb3 that's madness i've seen it\cb1 \
\cb3 no one men don't want that ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 can you understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the problem with being a having\cb1 \
\cb3 children already\cb1 \
\cb3 because you would have two kids by me\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids over here\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet if they want to go to college\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm still supposed to pay for it if your\cb1 \
\cb3 children want to go to college i still i\cb1 \
\cb3 got to put a roof over their head\cb1 \
\cb3 food in their bellies and provide for\cb1 \
\cb3 them just like i was providing for kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 and kim\cb1 \
\cb3 except this is ultimately the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 with being a woman with children\cb1 \
\cb3 i have been a stepfather i know\cb1 \
\cb3 i know of what i speak and if you look\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies if you honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 think that men don't realize\cb1 \
\cb3 especially in today's world with access\cb1 \
\cb3 to all the information we have\cb1 \
\cb3 that this is what's likely going to meet\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 as a potential step parent you're\cb1 \
\cb3 kidding yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 women with children should be in my\cb1 \
\cb3 personal opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 should be doing far more effort on\cb1 \
\cb3 increasing and improving and overcoming\cb1 \
\cb3 the liability or deficit that they bring\cb1 \
\cb3 to the table with just children\cb1 \
\cb3 and but the thing is we're not supposed\cb1 \
\cb3 to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not supposed to say that because\cb1 \
\cb3 it's but the reality is\cb1 \
\cb3 it is still there\cb1 \
\cb3 go to the asian community uh you not\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing a bunch of baby mamas getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why they don't have a lot of them\cb1 \
\cb3 we have normalized this\cb1 \
\cb3 but now the pendulum is swinging back\cb1 \
\cb3 the other way\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're starting to see pretty baby\cb1 \
\cb3 mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 still out here trying to figure out\cb1 \
\cb3 what's wrong with men\cb1 \
\cb3 is that men are the problem kevin and\cb1 \
\cb3 kim\cb1 \
\cb3 let's say you and i divorced oh yeah by\cb1 \
\cb3 the way\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you you can leave my channel too man\cb1 \
\cb3 enough\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin and kim are mine i still got\cb1 \
\cb3 visitation\cb1 \
\cb3 do i necessarily have anything with\cb1 \
\cb3 those kids if you decide not to\cb1 \
\cb3 let me see my step kids you could cut\cb1 \
\cb3 that bond\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies never think of it from a\cb1 \
\cb3 man's side it's all what\cb1 \
\cb3 you want and like you said you want a\cb1 \
\cb3 man to not be into all this superficial\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff another day\cb1 \
\cb3 which means you really don't give a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 what we think\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's another problem\cb1 \
\cb3 they women tend to think about it from\cb1 \
\cb3 what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 their side they don't really care to\cb1 \
\cb3 think what men\cb1 \
\cb3 want or from our side\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's not getting them the outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 they want so\cb1 \
\cb3 like what i say how i say it like my\cb1 \
\cb3 methods dislike my methods it doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 matter\cb1 \
\cb3 the outcome and i try my best to\cb1 \
\cb3 actually bring her to up to speed with\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on in the real world\cb1 \
\cb3 but we'll see we're just supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 come in and do what you need\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fine but you better be offering a\cb1 \
\cb3 hell of a deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and i do have to hear that only because\cb1 \
\cb3 of the kids\cb1 \
\cb3 well the kids are big man they are big\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean here's the thing you do have the\cb1 \
\cb3 option\cb1 \
\cb3 because you say only cause of the kids\cb1 \
\cb3 but that's a big deal\cb1 \
\cb3 would you date oh so you dating a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 with children is like off the table for\cb1 \
\cb3 you i married a woman with a child ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 i understand what i'm talking about am i\cb1 \
\cb3 just doing\cb1 \
\cb3 no i would not dated one more the child\cb1 \
\cb3 no i wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been there and the thing is where's\cb1 \
\cb3 the children's father\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i left him where is he alive\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah is he involved in the children's\cb1 \
\cb3 life at all\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah then if you really are serious\cb1 \
\cb3 give custody to the father go off with\cb1 \
\cb3 your go\cb1 \
\cb3 off with your new husband and make a\cb1 \
\cb3 natasha graham\cb1 \
\cb3 asks why would you spank a child that is\cb1 \
\cb3 not yours\cb1 \
\cb3 seems like a mental issue to me\cb1 \
\cb3 um i want you guys to let that marinate\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody stop what you're doing to look\cb1 \
\cb3 at natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to o'shea i'm gonna use\cb1 \
\cb3 something don't say nothing to her just\cb1 \
\cb3 look at natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody look at natasha graham who\cb1 \
\cb3 asks\cb1 \
\cb3 why would you spank a child that is not\cb1 \
\cb3 yours seems like a mental issue to me\cb1 \
\cb3 again she she pulls something straight\cb1 \
\cb3 out of the black woman's playbook\cb1 \
\cb3 shame insults guilt the need to be right\cb1 \
\cb3 the insult the guilt\cb1 \
\cb3 see if you want to exert control\cb1 \
\cb3 in your household as a step parent\cb1 \
\cb3 women like natasha want there's\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 mentally to be wrong with you so natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 can go out and make a child with\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody else\cb1 \
\cb3 and bring him into your household as\cb1 \
\cb3 your wife and your stepchild\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you want to discipline your child\cb1 \
\cb3 her child your your step child as you\cb1 \
\cb3 would discipline any other child\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to have a mental issue this is\cb1 \
\cb3 what\cb1 \
\cb3 is too this happens far too often\cb1 \
\cb3 with women in our community\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am seek help you sound\cb1 \
\cb3 zip damn crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 anything is men aren't taking this\cb1 \
\cb3 anymore you're gonna have to come up\cb1 \
\cb3 with a new playbook\cb1 \
\cb3 this color purpling waiting to exhale\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] this\cb1 \
\cb3 this not the same stuff is not working\cb1 \
\cb3 anymore\cb1 \
\cb3 your tactics or tricks are old and\cb1 \
\cb3 played out\cb1 \
\cb3 do better just say\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know what the hell i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about and i don't understand what's\cb1 \
\cb3 going on\cb1 \
\cb3 other than trying to infer that you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on you sound like you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a mental issue\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you here matter of fact she uh\cb1 \
\cb3 when she comes back off timeout\cb1 \
\cb3 moderators all right everybody lock and\cb1 \
\cb3 load on her\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody lock and load on her she says\cb1 \
\cb3 one more thing\cb1 \
\cb3 out of line time her out\cb1 \
\cb3 because i've seen her name pop up in\cb1 \
\cb3 here before and i'm tired of you\cb1 \
\cb3 women who don't seem to like to play\cb1 \
\cb3 don't you want to hate watching me hate\cb1 \
\cb3 watch\cb1 \
\cb3 don't talk family see oh i couldn't do\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 well well then guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 buy a dog and wait till they're out of\cb1 \
\cb3 the house man because\cb1 \
\cb3 is he involved in the children's life at\cb1 \
\cb3 all yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 then if you really are serious give\cb1 \
\cb3 custody to the father\cb1 \
\cb3 go off with your go off with your new\cb1 \
\cb3 husband and make a new family\cb1 \
\cb3 see oh i couldn't do that well well\cb1 \
\cb3 again what's wrong with that\cb1 \
\cb3 if you really the\cb1 \
\cb3 women you want to you want to make\cb1 \
\cb3 children with another man\cb1 \
\cb3 fine then if you get married\cb1 \
\cb3 send the children with the father and\cb1 \
\cb3 you make a new family\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i couldn't do that so you want it all\cb1 \
\cb3 and you've been told you can have it all\cb1 \
\cb3 and you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 because that man would have influence in\cb1 \
\cb3 your new husband's\cb1 \
\cb3 house that won't work and because women\cb1 \
\cb3 like natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 why'd you want to put your hands because\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot have children\cb1 \
\cb3 that you are responsible for that you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 again you sound zip damn crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 and guess what buy a dog\cb1 \
\cb3 and wait till they're out of the house\cb1 \
\cb3 man because i've talked about women like\cb1 \
\cb3 you all the time\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not willing to give anything up i\cb1 \
\cb3 asked you about discipline they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 need this they don't need that\cb1 \
\cb3 give up custody i don't can't do that\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 fit i mean no disrespect ma'am but\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not really fit\cb1 \
\cb3 to be with somebody you want someone to\cb1 \
\cb3 fit into your\cb1 \
\cb3 particular jagged life and why would\cb1 \
\cb3 a man who has options choose that\cb1 \
\cb3 just because you're attractive and yes\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe we need to start telling more\cb1 \
\cb3 women that you are not\cb1 \
\cb3 fit to be with somebody because we don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 any problems telling men you ain't ready\cb1 \
\cb3 saying you're not fit is another way of\cb1 \
\cb3 saying you're not ready your money ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 ready your mindset ain't ready you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to be a provider protect you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not fit you cannot take we tell\cb1 \
\cb3 men that all the time\cb1 \
\cb3 what do we think that telling women\cb1 \
\cb3 that they're fit just because they're\cb1 \
\cb3 female\cb1 \
\cb3 because they want to get married uh show\cb1 \
\cb3 me show me that they're fit\cb1 \
\cb3 show me that the women who say they want\cb1 \
\cb3 something are fit for it\cb1 \
\cb3 because we have no problem evaluating\cb1 \
\cb3 and ranking men and it's time to start\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women the same thing\cb1 \
\cb3 because the results are showing what the\cb1 \
\cb3 truth is already telling us\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you're attractive but but in la\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a dime a dozen\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you you have to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 though\cb1 \
\cb3 i no i do know that but i think i'm more\cb1 \
\cb3 simple than just the way i look\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've said i'm i'm definitely more\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable than\cb1 \
\cb3 just my lips granted granted i'm never\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing that you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm from the midwest i'm a good\cb1 \
\cb3 midwestern girl i'm not a\cb1 \
\cb3 girl she's from the midwest\cb1 \
\cb3 she's a good midwestern girl that's what\cb1 \
\cb3 she\cb1 \
\cb3 remember this oh you cannot make this\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 let's do that again\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 but in la that's a dime a dozen\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you you have to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 though\cb1 \
\cb3 i no i do know that but i think i'm more\cb1 \
\cb3 people than just the way i look\cb1 \
\cb3 what i said i'm i'm definitely more\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable than\cb1 \
\cb3 just my lips granted granted i'm never\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing that you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm from the midwest i'm a good\cb1 \
\cb3 midwestern girl i'm not a\cb1 \
\cb3 girl she's more valuable than look she's\cb1 \
\cb3 for the midwest she's a good midwestern\cb1 \
\cb3 girl\cb1 \
\cb3 she's not like one of these la women\cb1 \
\cb3 remember that\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i'm from oklahoma ma'am i'm from\cb1 \
\cb3 the midwest too but what i'm saying is\cb1 \

\cb3 man that you want what would he want\cb1 \

\cb3 like just at the end of the day is just\cb1 \
\cb3 like pure connection like do i\cb1 \
\cb3 notice how i asked her what he would\cb1 \
\cb3 want and she is so\cb1 \
\cb3 self-absorbed that she couldn't even\cb1 \
\cb3 put herself in the position to ask what\cb1 \
\cb3 he would want\cb1 \
\cb3 she said what would he want well at the\cb1 \
\cb3 end of the day he would want what i want\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty privileged self-absorbed entitled\cb1 \
\cb3 think the world is about them oh you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot make this [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot make this [ __ ] up she\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly said\cb1 \
\cb3 that a man who's had to get out here and\cb1 \
\cb3 make something of himself\cb1 \
\cb3 automatically would have the only thing\cb1 \
\cb3 he would want is what the french toast\cb1 \
\cb3 she wants\cb1 \
\cb3 just connection connection just\cb1 \
\cb3 connection that's just connection\cb1 \
\cb3 what connection\cb1 \
\cb3 all he would want is just what i want\cb1 \
\cb3 you know and what did i tell the\cb1 \
\cb3 young lady the other day uh you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be with somebody for a lifetime the most\cb1 \
\cb3 important decision\cb1 \
\cb3 and y'all are just down with it you just\cb1 \
\cb3 think it's supposed to happen\cb1 \
\cb3 you put no thought into this and yet you\cb1 \
\cb3 want a man to commit to you\cb1 \
\cb3 and take on two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 on some connection like\cb1 \

\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 just love do i want this person do i\cb1 \

\cb3 laughter\cb1 \
\cb3 joy excitement what does he want from a\cb1 \
\cb3 wife ma'am and you gave me\cb1 \
\cb3 oh what does he want from like just a\cb1 \
\cb3 wife like maybe just a good\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife a woman that cooks for her\cb1 \
\cb3 okay ma'am so let me ask you\cb1 \
\cb3 so i want you to understand how much\cb1 \
\cb3 these i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 put what kind of thought they put in i\cb1 \
\cb3 just asked what would he want\cb1 \
\cb3 and she and you know the answer was i\cb1 \
\cb3 have no idea all i know is what the\cb1 \
\cb3 french toast i want that's how absorbed\cb1 \
\cb3 i am\cb1 \
\cb3 i want you to take care of me and my\cb1 \
\cb3 kids because i'm pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 and pretty has got me this far in life\cb1 \
\cb3 and this should keep on getting me\cb1 \
\cb3 through\cb1 \
\cb3 she still thinks she's the ish has not\cb1 \
\cb3 sat down and learned anything\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids and and uh situation children\cb1 \
\cb3 don't tend to teach\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty baby mamas nothing because they\cb1 \
\cb3 still get\cb1 \
\cb3 people trying to take them out to dinner\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to flute them out trying\cb1 \
\cb3 everything else\cb1 \
\cb3 but they're not getting wived they're\cb1 \
\cb3 not getting wife by men of value\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable men productive competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 all you are is a fun girl but just\cb1 \
\cb3 because somebody will still deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 hit it you still have not again\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot make this [ __ ] up oh we're\cb1 \
\cb3 almost there give me another five\cb1 \
\cb3 minutes\cb1 \
\cb3 question were your mother and father\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 no all right then it's\cb1 \
\cb3 then you were not raised to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife no i don't think i\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely was not raised to you know\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 so he would want a housewife but she\cb1 \
\cb3 laughs and said i definitely was not\cb1 \
\cb3 raised to be no housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's smart though i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 my dad seems to go off\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what she said he would want right\cb1 \
\cb3 and she wasn't raised to be that thing\cb1 \
\cb3 so i guess you could just decide to do\cb1 \
\cb3 that just\cb1 \
\cb3 huh that's for sure but listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen i'm hoping that dream i\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot give up on that hope and that\cb1 \
\cb3 dream again it's a hope and dream for\cb1 \
\cb3 who\cb1 \
\cb3 you sound like a nightmare for another\cb1 \
\cb3 man sounds like a nightmare\cb1 \
\cb3 for your possible husband cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 his step you ain't gonna discipline the\cb1 \
\cb3 stepchildren\cb1 \
\cb3 woman that wasn't raised to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously put little thought into a man\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman who's stringing a man on for two\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 let's not forget about the dude she's\cb1 \
\cb3 stringing on for two years and allowing\cb1 \
\cb3 him to take her ring shop and let's not\cb1 \
\cb3 forget that\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a man out there that she's been\cb1 \
\cb3 saying she's been seriously dealing with\cb1 \
\cb3 for two years\cb1 \
\cb3 and they went ring shopping three months\cb1 \
\cb3 ago that means she went with him\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet on this podcast he's saying i\cb1 \
\cb3 just you know i'm just not uh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah guys do not be afraid to ask\cb1 \
\cb3 these women anything especially don't be\cb1 \
\cb3 bad that's why you don't treat pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 women any differently\cb1 \
\cb3 far to me you guys look at a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty and you start ascribing behaviors\cb1 \
\cb3 to her no no you better treat her like\cb1 \
\cb3 big burly shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 and ask the questions that need to be\cb1 \
\cb3 asked because pretty privileged\cb1 \
\cb3 especially pretty baby mamas will get\cb1 \
\cb3 you done in\cb1 \
\cb3 because honestly far too many of them\cb1 \
\cb3 still walk through life thinking they\cb1 \
\cb3 are the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 if you i'ma slap the smack out of you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll let you go man but you cannot over\cb1 \
\cb3 talk me\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm trying to be nice man but you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna do that\cb1 \
\cb3 look you weren't raised to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 and you just said the kind of man that\cb1 \
\cb3 you would want what he wanted as a good\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 then he wouldn't want you because you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not one\cb1 \
\cb3 by your own admission you're not one\cb1 \
\cb3 i wasn't raised to be one which means\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not one\cb1 \
\cb3 but i had great influences if you had\cb1 \
\cb3 such great influences\cb1 \
\cb3 one on one\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 what you just witnessed was pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 privilege\cb1 \
\cb3 she's used to getting by on her above\cb1 \
\cb3 average looks\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's got below average outcomes and\cb1 \
\cb3 no matter how i try to talk to her\cb1 \
\cb3 she's going to sit there and stamp her\cb1 \
\cb3 feet because\cb1 \
\cb3 she was going to get her way i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 trying\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not hard\cb1 \
\cb3 not out to foster media for the great\cb1 \
\cb3 thing at the end all right why is all\cb1 \
\cb3 this make a point\cb1 \
\cb3 why is all this making the point well\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm glad you asked\cb1 \
\cb3 glad you asked because i never do\cb1 \
\cb3 anything\cb1 \
\cb3 or without without uh\cb1 \
\cb3 without a reason this happens\cb1 \
\cb3 far too often with women who are pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty baby mamas entitled self-absorbed\cb1 \
\cb3 deluded thinking that they can still go\cb1 \
\cb3 out into the world\cb1 \
\cb3 and act as if they are still the hot\cb1 \
\cb3 little thing they were with noah\cb1 \
\cb3 would just be just because they have\cb1 \
\cb3 gotten a gym lost the weight\cb1 \
\cb3 they look in the mirror and they see\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves the way they used to be but\cb1 \
\cb3 the world\cb1 \
\cb3 sees that you have one two people come\cb1 \
\cb3 out of your body\cb1 \
\cb3 and all of those experiences that came\cb1 \
\cb3 along with it those are\cb1 \
\cb3 those are city miles those aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 highway miles\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so i'm about to open the call\cb1 \
\cb3 line but you know what this story has an\cb1 \
\cb3 interesting ending\cb1 \
\cb3 in the comment section and when that\cb1 \
\cb3 show happened i actually pulled that\cb1 \
\cb3 interview out\cb1 \
\cb3 and i posted those a video and it's got\cb1 \
\cb3 over 150 000 views\cb1 \
\cb3 lots of comments and many people\cb1 \
\cb3 you know there have been several people\cb1 \
\cb3 who've talked about the video\cb1 \
\cb3 but some of the women some of the people\cb1 \
\cb3 have made comments you were too mean you\cb1 \
\cb3 were this your dad\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't give her a chance you i think\cb1 \
\cb3 you misread her\cb1 \
\cb3 and and that's and i'm like i just went\cb1 \
\cb3 off what she said but\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a firm believer and let someone talk\cb1 \
\cb3 long enough and they will tell you who\cb1 \
\cb3 they are\cb1 \
\cb3 let's see so like i said\cb1 \
\cb3 when i go into a new town i set all my\cb1 \
\cb3 dating apps\cb1 \
\cb3 oh looky there\cb1 \
\cb3 looky there guess who popped up in my\cb1 \
\cb3 dating app\cb1 \
\cb3 yup that's right\cb1 \
\cb3 so i liked the picture and i said what a\cb1 \
\cb3 small world we have\cb1 \
\cb3 indeed\cb1 \
\cb3 and her response was hmm that it is\cb1 \
\cb3 oh\cb1 \
\cb3 next question where are the kids i sold\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 now response was what would you like for\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 because she initiated a chat i liked the\cb1 \
\cb3 picture\cb1 \
\cb3 said it was a small world we have indeed\cb1 \
\cb3 part of me was not\cb1 \
\cb3 quite sure that was her i looked at her\cb1 \
\cb3 i was like maybe that's her maybe it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'll just i'll just see what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on\cb1 \
\cb3 um dear i can't make this [ __ ] up i\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make it up make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 i cannot make this up what would you\cb1 \
\cb3 like for me\cb1 \
\cb3 i have no agenda to be honest wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 very familiar with you before i went\cb1 \
\cb3 live\cb1 \
\cb3 cool\cb1 \
\cb3 hmm i definitely sat on the wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 table unprepared fine\cb1 \
\cb3 again i'm a reasonable person\cb1 \
\cb3 try to make reasonable inferences i\cb1 \
\cb3 thought it was a i was doing my best\cb1 \
\cb3 to try to inform a caller of what she\cb1 \
\cb3 was asking\cb1 \
\cb3 and give her the best advice possible\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm always curious\cb1 \
\cb3 as to once you have a chance to look at\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 once you have a chance to sit back and\cb1 \
\cb3 see how the interaction played between\cb1 \
\cb3 both of us\cb1 \
\cb3 how you how other people perceived it\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i go back and look at some of\cb1 \
\cb3 my work and say you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i was wrong on that maybe i was\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i was wrong maybe i could have did\cb1 \
\cb3 this better\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm hard on myself because i'm always\cb1 \
\cb3 like you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to be if someone calls me i want\cb1 \
\cb3 to be able to give them the best\cb1 \
\cb3 most accurate thing that i can tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a perfectionist that way and\cb1 \
\cb3 oftentimes i run into people who i've\cb1 \
\cb3 talked to before\cb1 \
\cb3 um actually people i've actually had\cb1 \
\cb3 hard interactions with have become\cb1 \
\cb3 actually i wouldn't call them friends\cb1 \
\cb3 but you know colleagues and associates\cb1 \
\cb3 all right and the thing is you should be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to have a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 as you move on and not have a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're dealing with somebody who's\cb1 \
\cb3 balanced\cb1 \
\cb3 big curiosity all right what's your\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what did i get i make the next point\cb1 \
\cb3 here we go definitely sat on the wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 end of the table\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm prepared all right next\cb1 \
\cb3 what is your agenda in sending me a like\cb1 \
\cb3 oh there's no way to say hello\cb1 \
\cb3 so a like is all you have on these apps\cb1 \
\cb3 now remember when i said\cb1 \
\cb3 earlier pay attention\cb1 \
\cb3 i just said one word guess\cb1 \
\cb3 why did i say guess because i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 see\cb1 \
\cb3 if what i said was on point\cb1 \
\cb3 did i was i too harsh did i\cb1 \
\cb3 did i misread the situation\cb1 \
\cb3 and the response is you'll see it right\cb1 \
\cb3 here guess\cb1 \
\cb3 guess you must do this often\cb1 \
\cb3 you couldn't possibly think i let you\cb1 \
\cb3 blow my back out\cb1 \
\cb3 gross\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 51. the only thing i let you do\cb1 \
\cb3 is take me shopping and feed me\cb1 \
\cb3 and maybe eat my pedesta if you beg\cb1 \
\cb3 so remember the i'm a good person\cb1 \
\cb3 good middle midwestern girl all this\cb1 \
\cb3 other kind of stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 now um i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 where you kind of you can't make this\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] up people\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the response\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the response\cb1 \
\cb3 and my response is well just just like\cb1 \
\cb3 our conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 you still proved you're sadly deluded\cb1 \
\cb3 self-absorbed\cb1 \
\cb3 and entitled everything i said about you\cb1 \
\cb3 was spot on and i really hope\cb1 \
\cb3 you seek the help you need as i said\cb1 \
\cb3 your issue as i said men are not your\cb1 \
\cb3 issue\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 dear heart\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to check yourself and women\cb1 \
\cb3 like you really need\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty privilege when it meets baby mama\cb1 \
\cb3 ism\cb1 \
\cb3 the world is difficult enough without\cb1 \
\cb3 you walking around thinking that\cb1 \
\cb3 everyone\cb1 \
\cb3 wants you\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make this [ __ ] up oh i forgot\cb1 \
\cb3 one thing too let me go ahead and put\cb1 \
\cb3 this down there\cb1 \
\cb3 uh 30 year old 5'6 and she classifies\cb1 \
\cb3 herself as a thug\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it you're spiritual\cb1 \
\cb3 and you like thugs or you classify\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself as a thug\cb1 \
\cb3 so there you go\cb1 \
\cb3 i come to la and just like when i went\cb1 \
\cb3 to new york\cb1 \
\cb3 or anywhere anywhere where i go when i\cb1 \
\cb3 moved when you came to atlanta\cb1 \
\cb3 you followed me for the longest you know\cb1 \
\cb3 that i set my apps and i do the same\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 but you honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 can take a lesson from what i just\cb1 \
\cb3 showed you when someone shows you who\cb1 \
\cb3 they are believe them the first time\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem is not men especially for\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you pretty above average\cb1 \
\cb3 looking\cb1 \
\cb3 single baby mamas your issues with men\cb1 \
\cb3 you heap them on everybody else and\cb1 \
\cb3 assume that they are the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 no man we're not\cb1 \
\cb3 you are and women like you are\cb1 \
\cb3 so this was a long broadcast\cb1 \
\cb3 but you just can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 now if a person was as good and\cb1 \
\cb3 wholesome as you say you are\cb1 \
\cb3 hey what's a good back and forth i\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't like what you said\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but to think that i mean you're\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 um you can't make it up you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 ah she completely me\cb1 \
\cb3 so she's saying yeah yeah oh yeah that's\cb1 \
\cb3 what she said\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what she said she said what is\cb1 \
\cb3 your agenda agenda\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't even i wasn't even quite sure\cb1 \
\cb3 that was you\cb1 \
\cb3 really saying hey how you doing how you\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to see it again\cb1 \
\cb3 what's your agenda uh just let's make it\cb1 \
\cb3 up again\cb1 \
\cb3 small world um that it is\cb1 \
\cb3 where the kids i sold them\cb1 \
\cb3 because the kids were part of the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you like for me i have no\cb1 \
\cb3 agenda to be honest i was very\cb1 \
\cb3 unfamiliar with you\cb1 \
\cb3 before you went live now\cb1 \
\cb3 but ladies definitely at the wrong end\cb1 \
\cb3 of the table unprepared\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fair\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies when a man every time a man\cb1 \
\cb3 reaches out to you\cb1 \
\cb3 just because you've had bad experiences\cb1 \
\cb3 other men\cb1 \
\cb3 stop assuming that everybody wants you\cb1 \
\cb3 um i want to move it away from her\cb1 \
\cb3 because i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 make this personal about her at this\cb1 \
\cb3 point but\cb1 \
\cb3 sadly a lot of attractive women\cb1 \
\cb3 especially women who've had bad\cb1 \
\cb3 interactions with men\cb1 \
\cb3 tend not to go get the work done\cb1 \
\cb3 and you want to paint all men\cb1 \
\cb3 in a in the box of being bad\cb1 \
\cb3 when you really need to handle the\cb1 \
\cb3 issues that are going on in your own\cb1 \
\cb3 head\cb1 \
\cb3 because all i said was guess to this\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and then she and she showed what she\cb1 \
\cb3 thought of men\cb1 \
\cb3 and men in general again go back to the\cb1 \
\cb3 beginning of the show\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem is all these men who just\cb1 \
\cb3 want a pretty woman on her arm and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's it\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make it up so it didn't matter\cb1 \
\cb3 that i sat there and talked to you\cb1 \
\cb3 tried to give you good advice give you\cb1 \
\cb3 good information\cb1 \
\cb3 all men ain't crap and ultimately guys\cb1 \
\cb3 avoid women like this don't fall\cb1 \
\cb3 for the pretty when it's attached to\cb1 \
\cb3 damage\cb1 \
\cb3 don't be afraid to ask questions that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know need to be answered\cb1 \
\cb3 again you can't make this [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 for for the record\cb1 \
\cb3 now if i wanted to that's why i cut your\cb1 \
\cb3 pictures back and everything else\cb1 \
\cb3 you must do this often do what say hello\cb1 \
\cb3 to somebody on a dating app\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean ladies did i ask her anything\cb1 \
\cb3 other than\cb1 \
\cb3 hi\cb1 \
\cb3 you couldn't possibly let me thank you i\cb1 \
\cb3 let you blow my back out\cb1 \
\cb3 i really don't want to be insulting but\cb1 \
\cb3 you're attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 but dear it's la\cb1 \
\cb3 like i said on the call\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty's not i'm not it's not that\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not that hard to come by it's\cb1 \
\cb3 really not\cb1 \
\cb3 um and if you honestly think that that's\cb1 \
\cb3 the way\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman should respond\cb1 \
\cb3 to a man who didn't ask you anything you\cb1 \
\cb3 need more help\cb1 \
\cb3 than i that obviously our conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't help you\cb1 \
\cb3 um but i do hope you seek some help and\cb1 \
\cb3 i hope women like you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you see any of this in yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies understand something\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't keep keeping your issues on\cb1 \
\cb3 men you can't keep making us\cb1 \
\cb3 all responsible for your shortcomings\cb1 \
\cb3 for your outcomes and far too long\cb1 \
\cb3 we've done that we've absolved women for\cb1 \
\cb3 their responsibility\cb1 \
\cb3 their accountability and and how they've\cb1 \
\cb3 gotten to where they are\cb1 \
\cb3 and said oh she's the victim you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 a victim\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the fact that she says something like\cb1 \
\cb3 that barely knowing someone shows how\cb1 \
\cb3 crashy is\cb1 \
\cb3 oh dude dude the the spiritual thug\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 took me yeah so uh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 then yeah i said you can't make this\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] up not make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 wow um\cb1 \
\cb3 you just can't make it all right so uh\cb1 \

\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 there you go thank you guys for hanging\cb1 \
\cb3 in there it was a long presentation but\cb1 \
\cb3 uh the payoff had was a good one\cb1 \
\cb3 again you can't make this stuff up you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make this stuff up\cb1 \
\cb3 wow you can't make that up\cb1 \
\cb3 you just can't make that up\cb1 \
\cb3 part of the problem in modern\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 is we have unbalance we have all we have\cb1 \
\cb3 men out here\cb1 \
\cb3 being told to increase and improve get\cb1 \
\cb3 better\cb1 \
\cb3 protect provide all these things and\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not telling women that they need\cb1 \
\cb3 to do anything other than exist\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact we we have gotten to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point where we're telling women\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can show up in any any in any\cb1 \
\cb3 way you can show up\cb1 \
\cb3 a dress size 20 i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 you can show up with a man's kids\cb1 \
\cb3 and we're all supposed to just accept it\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's not working it's not working\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not working and it won't work\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 they would rather be by themselves to\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with some of this foolishness and\cb1 \
\cb3 efforty\cb1 \
\cb3 that is going on today in modern dating\cb1 \
\cb3 situations\cb1 \
\cb3 and what are you ladies prepared to do\cb1 \
\cb3 about it what are you prepared to do\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 other than blame men because that won't\cb1 \
\cb3 work\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot continue to blame men it's\cb1 \
\cb3 the men's fault\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 so here's how this is going to work\cb1 \
\cb3 here's how this is going to work you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to have to make sure you have your\cb1 \
\cb3 microphone on\cb1 \
\cb3 youtube off in the background\cb1 \
\cb3 and talking to me\cb1 \
\cb3 oh napa auto parts what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm well\cb1 \
\cb3 well considering how i've listened to\cb1 \
\cb3 how you and your colleagues have\cb1 \
\cb3 discussed\cb1 \
\cb3 me i think that's pretty fair i've never\cb1 \
\cb3 been disrespectful but how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 well i'm good i don't know well i said\cb1 \
\cb3 you and your colleagues\cb1 \
\cb3 misrepresent you i personally listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 you misrepresent what i've said\cb1 \
\cb3 so anywho i apologize i apologize if i\cb1 \
\cb3 misrepresented you i just you know most\cb1 \
\cb3 of the time i just had\cb1 \
\cb3 questions about you know the value\cb1 \
\cb3 the high value man and i i really got\cb1 \
\cb3 those questions answered i got them\cb1 \
\cb3 answered\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know i had i did a sit down with\cb1 \
\cb3 obsidian\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah but due respect obsidian is not me\cb1 \
\cb3 and i watched no no but my point is\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um i would not go i would not go\cb1 \
\cb3 um to someone who's pioneered a concept\cb1 \
\cb3 and asked someone who's just familiar\cb1 \
\cb3 with it obsidian has a point of view but\cb1 \
\cb3 he's a friend\cb1 \
\cb3 but he wanted to speak to me i've also\cb1 \
\cb3 given you an opportunity to speak to me\cb1 \
\cb3 i just\cb1 \
\cb3 i i put it this way um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to have a conversation you\cb1 \
\cb3 have it uh\cb1 \
\cb3 with good faith and the way that i've\cb1 \
\cb3 actually witnessed the conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 being had about the man of sphere or\cb1 \
\cb3 guys in the man on sphere\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't listen to other people i've sat\cb1 \
\cb3 back and watched\cb1 \
\cb3 the interactions and i've made my own\cb1 \
\cb3 judgment and that's not what i've seen\cb1 \
\cb3 from you\cb1 \
\cb3 or anyone else on that side when asked\cb1 \
\cb3 have you ever watched my content\cb1 \
\cb3 you said no not a one you have not\cb1 \
\cb3 watched the show from end to end\cb1 \
\cb3 so i don't see the value in having a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation if you can't even be\cb1 \
\cb3 bothered to sit down and watch\cb1 \
\cb3 a broadcast fair enough okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for um you know sharing that\cb1 \
\cb3 sentiment with sentiment with me and as\cb1 \

\cb3 reasonable person\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll be nice to you if you're nice to me\cb1 \
\cb3 so let's say devon\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hi how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on i'll need you guys in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room you guys be respectful to uh\cb1 \
\cb3 nepal and the reason i called you napa\cb1 \
\cb3 out because i don't i really don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 how to pronounce your name\cb1 \
\cb3 so it wasn't to be insulting it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 because i don't know how to pronounce\cb1 \
\cb3 your name so\cb1 \
\cb3 be uh moderators make sure that they're\cb1 \
\cb3 respectful of her in the in the comments\cb1 \
\cb3 section please\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead what you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 dionne a quick question so\cb1 \
\cb3 i was definitely one of those women\cb1 \
\cb3 i say suffering from pretty girl\cb1 \
\cb3 privilege\cb1 \
\cb3 and luckily i have gotten myself\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been dating and\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 the most compatible man that i'm dating\cb1 \
\cb3 right now has expressed\cb1 \
\cb3 interest in marriage we've been dating\cb1 \
\cb3 about four months\cb1 \
\cb3 however um because of\cb1 \
\cb3 covet and because of his line of work he\cb1 \
\cb3 is a\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i i would say high value man if\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely not definitely a henry\cb1 \
\cb3 but because of kovalev right now um his\cb1 \
\cb3 line of work he's an entertainer he's a\cb1 \
\cb3 lead singer\cb1 \
\cb3 and an art he is unsure when they'll be\cb1 \
\cb3 touring again so when we have these\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations he's like babe i'll marry\cb1 \
\cb3 you tomorrow\cb1 \
\cb3 but i need to make sure that i can be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to take care of you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the kids and you know it's a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 when you come with children so it's like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm grateful that i have a you know\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man that is willing to take\cb1 \
\cb3 care of me\cb1 \
\cb3 and the children but i definitely\cb1 \
\cb3 understand his position financially\cb1 \
\cb3 where he just doesn't know what the\cb1 \
\cb3 future may hold because his line of work\cb1 \
\cb3 is centered around\cb1 \
\cb3 entertaining people you know he i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty sure we will get back to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point of being able to\cb1 \
\cb3 you know go to concerts so so um\cb1 \
\cb3 so just be clear do you have a question\cb1 \
\cb3 for me or were you\cb1 \
\cb3 just um because i want to be yes\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the question you have for me so\cb1 \
\cb3 my question is\cb1 \
\cb3 should i just be patient how many\cb1 \
\cb3 children do you have\cb1 \
\cb3 i have two\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm 38. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm assuming you're already employed\cb1 \
\cb3 i am yes um i actually so so if you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 got\cb1 \
\cb3 so if you guys got married today okay\cb1 \
\cb3 and they automatically start touring and\cb1 \
\cb3 they and\cb1 \
\cb3 jobs are going great\cb1 \
\cb3 and then if god forbid he was called\cb1 \
\cb3 home to glory\cb1 \
\cb3 um you'd still be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 provide for yourself and the children\cb1 \
\cb3 just fine yes\cb1 \
\cb3 okay the reason i put it that way\cb1 \
\cb3 is his up and down is nothing that he\cb1 \
\cb3 can directly control\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm not a big fan of waiting\cb1 \
\cb3 if you are sure and he is sure\cb1 \
\cb3 because life can change like that\cb1 \
\cb3 and we spend so much time trying to wait\cb1 \
\cb3 for things to become\cb1 \
\cb3 perfect and we and we\cb1 \
\cb3 and we miss the moments in life that are\cb1 \
\cb3 meant to be\cb1 \
\cb3 chronicled with one another so um i\cb1 \
\cb3 i i definitely get a man wanting to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 provider and be able to do it he\cb1 \
\cb3 put the money where it needs to be but\cb1 \
\cb3 as it stands right now you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 be working\cb1 \
\cb3 by you're working anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 what is he is he is he working is he\cb1 \
\cb3 doing anything\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i mean luckily he's also very um\cb1 \
\cb3 very successful real estate investor so\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what's holding\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of the passive income okay are you\cb1 \
\cb3 guys living in the same sp in the same\cb1 \
\cb3 city\cb1 \
\cb3 yes we both live in in d.c do you have\cb1 \
\cb3 an apartment or a home\cb1 \
\cb3 i've rent an apartment okay and what\cb1 \
\cb3 about him\cb1 \
\cb3 same thing or different well no he owns\cb1 \
\cb3 his place\cb1 \
\cb3 and he owns other properties\cb1 \
\cb3 um well\cb1 \
\cb3 if he's serious i don't see the downside\cb1 \
\cb3 in proceeding\cb1 \
\cb3 right so i guess my question is it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 the proceeding but i think it was one\cb1 \
\cb3 call where you were just like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know you have to i'm not afraid of\cb1 \
\cb3 putting some parameters you know i know\cb1 \
\cb3 you say like some women are afraid to\cb1 \
\cb3 put parameters because they know the guy\cb1 \
\cb3 is going to walk you know\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm i'm i'm definitely unafraid of\cb1 \
\cb3 that i'm just wondering\cb1 \
\cb3 is it is it necessary because at this\cb1 \
\cb3 point this is probably the\cb1 \
\cb3 parameters i may get parameters meaning\cb1 \
\cb3 what\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning like we should be you know\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking about getting\cb1 \
\cb3 you know married by this day and he\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to have more children i would give\cb1 \
\cb3 him as many children as he wants\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm 38. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but does he does he if he wants to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 and he's serious you sound like you're\cb1 \
\cb3 open to it so\cb1 \
\cb3 um let him know i don't see what the\cb1 \
\cb3 holdup is on his side if he's serious\cb1 \
\cb3 about marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's it's it's i can tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's purely financial he just wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to make sure he can carry the\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the lifestyle i get it but\cb1 \
\cb3 again life happens um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to be with him make it clear\cb1 \
\cb3 to him that look i appreciate you want\cb1 \
\cb3 to be able to do that but i'd rather be\cb1 \
\cb3 with you\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm working anyway i mean i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 just not really\cb1 \
\cb3 there's too many things that are\cb1 \
\cb3 spinning right now that's why i have\cb1 \
\cb3 this little thing spinning over here you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't\cb1 \
\cb3 predict everything so um more often than\cb1 \
\cb3 not men want to know that you're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to you're going to be there through the\cb1 \
\cb3 up and the down\cb1 \
\cb3 more than anything else that's more than\cb1 \
\cb3 anything else so\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know if you've had the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation with him to say you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what i would i would hope you could make\cb1 \
\cb3 millions\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you if you make it enough to uh\cb1 \
\cb3 to take care of yourself i'm good with\cb1 \
\cb3 it we can eat peanut butter jelly and\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i mean i just don't see\cb1 \
\cb3 the downside\cb1 \
\cb3 get on with the living either get busy\cb1 \
\cb3 with living and get busy with dying and\cb1 \
\cb3 slaying by yourself especially if you\cb1 \
\cb3 got somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 who you're serious what he seriously do\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't really see the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem with that i appreciate you\cb1 \
\cb3 calling in man\cb1 \
\cb3 bye-bye yeah i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 we we can't have it perfect i get we\cb1 \
\cb3 want perfect but we don't get perfect\cb1 \
\cb3 we get it we get close enough all right\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 um ivory\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes your first name what do you got for\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 on how else i can grow to be more of a\cb1 \
\cb3 blessing to my future husband as a\cb1 \
\cb3 single mom\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right to your future husband\cb1 \
\cb3 yes are you seeing anyone seriously now\cb1 \
\cb3 no\cb1 \
\cb3 how many children do you have one\cb1 \
\cb3 uh age and gender he is four\cb1 \
\cb3 where's the father he\cb1 \
\cb3 abandoned us whenever i was still\cb1 \
\cb3 pregnant he's in the picture now and we\cb1 \
\cb3 split custody around 60 40. i'm the\cb1 \
\cb3 primary\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh is this through the court system\cb1 \
\cb3 or you guys just have a\cb1 \
\cb3 an arraignment courts yes all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 future men ultimately in order to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 is a precarious thing it really is\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been there um do you\cb1 \
\cb3 well one do you ever want to have any\cb1 \
\cb3 additional children\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm impartial if i\cb1 \
\cb3 am married to somebody and he wants that\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe in submission\cb1 \
\cb3 and i will give my husband children but\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 particularly care if i have more\cb1 \
\cb3 by the way i'm 29. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding how the child gets sorted\cb1 \
\cb3 out that's really the biggest thing\cb1 \
\cb3 the biggest issue when it comes to\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with a woman with children\cb1 \
\cb3 is discipline of the child provision\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously but discipline and\cb1 \
\cb3 if you if you've never really had to\cb1 \
\cb3 co-parent with anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 your word has been law\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you know as a man who's been a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 that child will quickly children test\cb1 \
\cb3 and they will quickly run understand\cb1 \
\cb3 where the lines are drawn would would\cb1 \
\cb3 the man you marry\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to parent your child\cb1 \
\cb3 as if he were the biological father\cb1 \
\cb3 i would hope so and that is next\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 can i ask yeah go ahead go ahead my next\cb1 \
\cb3 question is\cb1 \
\cb3 at what point would it be appropriate to\cb1 \
\cb3 introduce\cb1 \
\cb3 a man into my child's life because i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to just\cb1 \
\cb3 bring anybody that i'm interested in\cb1 \
\cb3 into my child's life\cb1 \
\cb3 and i've heard about setting boundaries\cb1 \
\cb3 of if you're engaged that would be the\cb1 \
\cb3 appropriate time and i am\cb1 \
\cb3 very adamant on teaching my child to be\cb1 \
\cb3 respectful\cb1 \
\cb3 and okay so in general i mean yeah you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need to be bringing them around\cb1 \
\cb3 people you're dating\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but and you know\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing i think engagement is a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice milestone but it's not very\cb1 \
\cb3 realistic because there's going to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot to happen before that\cb1 \
\cb3 the question ultimately comes down to\cb1 \
\cb3 um where's your husband going to fit\cb1 \
\cb3 because ma'am your child comes first\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you how do you navigate putting a\cb1 \
\cb3 man first\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not sure i understand what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 asking because my\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning your child is your number one\cb1 \
\cb3 priority right now\cb1 \
\cb3 right now yes if you were to meet a man\cb1 \
\cb3 especially a man of\cb1 \
\cb3 a valuable man a man i mean he is going\cb1 \
\cb3 to have to become number one that means\cb1 \
\cb3 your child is going to have to become\cb1 \
\cb3 number two\cb1 \
\cb3 within the marriage i believe so no no\cb1 \
\cb3 see that's the problem that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 you a man would have to marry you and\cb1 \
\cb3 and hope\cb1 \
\cb3 that that would happen and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 unrealistic\cb1 \
\cb3 see you're going to have to resolve how\cb1 \
\cb3 to make this is why it's so difficult\cb1 \
\cb3 uh dating and seriously data is a single\cb1 \
\cb3 mother\cb1 \
\cb3 you your child is your number one\cb1 \
\cb3 priority as it should be\cb1 \
\cb3 but the way the world is supposed to be\cb1 \
\cb3 set up you're supposed to be married to\cb1 \
\cb3 the father your child so you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 to deal with these things\cb1 \
\cb3 yes what you're ultimately asking a man\cb1 \
\cb3 to do is marry me\cb1 \
\cb3 then trust me that i will do what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 you say because i say i'm submissive and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 that's just the bet that no smart man\cb1 \
\cb3 should take\cb1 \
\cb3 not today we have too many cases of\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 flipping the script on men and it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 unreasonable this is why i often tell\cb1 \
\cb3 women if you're serious\cb1 \
\cb3 uh give custody do you have a son or a\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter\cb1 \
\cb3 a son at seven years old he should be\cb1 \
\cb3 with his daddy anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 he said that's more that's why i said\cb1 \
\cb3 give custody to give custody to the\cb1 \
\cb3 father\cb1 \
\cb3 are you serious about even if your\cb1 \
\cb3 father is not masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't see again i can't nope you\cb1 \
\cb3 picked him\cb1 \
\cb3 you picked him and i got 60 40 anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 see what i'm hearing ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 is control issues which which is fair\cb1 \
\cb3 but you've never had to negotiate\cb1 \
\cb3 do anything with anybody else the word\cb1 \
\cb3 you are the queen and the word stops\cb1 \
\cb3 with you\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why single mothers are for fun\cb1 \
\cb3 and not for long term\cb1 \
\cb3 because let's say you were dating a man\cb1 \
\cb3 like myself i am not going to marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 and then\cb1 \
\cb3 let you tell me that you got to pay all\cb1 \
\cb3 the bills as if\cb1 \
\cb3 this is your biological child and then i\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta trust that you're gonna do things\cb1 \
\cb3 my way you know you gotta demonstrate\cb1 \
\cb3 that to me before i'm gonna make a\cb1 \
\cb3 lifelong commitment to you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i say you let you single\cb1 \
\cb3 mothers really gotta understand what\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking for men\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what that whole video was about\cb1 \
\cb3 that woman did not understand what she's\cb1 \
\cb3 asking\cb1 \
\cb3 lastly you you're saying that you\cb1 \
\cb3 are an indifferent to children then\cb1 \
\cb3 marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 the man possibly gets no kids and a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of liability\cb1 \
\cb3 and a non-masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 baby daddy in the picture and a boy to\cb1 \
\cb3 raise\cb1 \
\cb3 man that's that doesn't sound very\cb1 \
\cb3 appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 i hate to break it i have to be that\cb1 \
\cb3 direct but that's just doesn't sound\cb1 \
\cb3 very appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 but all the best thank you bye\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah ladies you know understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something when you just when you choose\cb1 \
\cb3 to make a child\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a big freaking deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and we have minimized it and made it no\cb1 \
\cb3 big deal because you can\cb1 \
\cb3 make have a job and take care of your\cb1 \
\cb3 kid that's fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but interacting with a man a completely\cb1 \
\cb3 different set of circumstances\cb1 \
\cb3 um tyra tiara\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm yourself hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes first name\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 well before we before we do that before\cb1 \
\cb3 we do that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and why should i have you come on\cb1 \
\cb3 and speak to the younger\cb1 \
\cb3 you haven't told me what you what that\cb1 \
\cb3 you why\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't make any sense to me you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to come in i'm preaching and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to come in and say by the way i\cb1 \
\cb3 need to talk to the people over here\cb1 \
\cb3 how do i know you even more talking to\cb1 \
\cb3 what you want to tell them\cb1 \
\cb3 okay go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 okay they always are\cb1 \
\cb3 wait a minute hold on you you you you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying thing okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you start talking about high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 and cautioning women\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am have you ever been married\cb1 \
\cb3 after the father of your child\cb1 \
\cb3 all right is he still in the child's\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so hi val are you\cb1 \
\cb3 currently seeing someone seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 so why are you why are you talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 why you think that is\cb1 \
\cb3 right and what are you calling a man of\cb1 \
\cb3 high value just his income\cb1 \
\cb3 no no i'm very specific about on my\cb1 \
\cb3 channel i'm very specific about what i\cb1 \
\cb3 call high value\cb1 \
\cb3 and what you ladies tend to do is you\cb1 \
\cb3 call high value things that aren't high\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 but a high value man is a man who makes\cb1 \
\cb3 a\cb1 \
\cb3 over six figures for at least five years\cb1 \
\cb3 in a row\cb1 \
\cb3 he's acknowledged by other high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men as being one of their peers\cb1 \
\cb3 has a network of high value men and\cb1 \
\cb3 other people\cb1 \
\cb3 has a career or a profession or\cb1 \
\cb3 something that's linkedin level\cb1 \
\cb3 people understand what it is at a glance\cb1 \
\cb3 and is useful to others and the group\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's a lot to be so if you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have one\cb1 \
\cb3 you want a man like this and why would a\cb1 \
\cb3 man like that\cb1 \
\cb3 who has most women want men like that\cb1 \
\cb3 right why would they want a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 already has a child by someone else\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why it's hard to get one\cb1 \
\cb3 because they're valuable\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's unrealistic to think i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 to say\cb1 \
\cb3 man to think this as a\cb1 \
\cb3 even as a divorcee with a child that\cb1 \
\cb3 you'll land one\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah don't get pregnant yeah don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 married before you carry that's right\cb1 \
\cb3 marry before you carry\cb1 \
\cb3 but the rest of your life you know if\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 hey what's the rest of your life going\cb1 \
\cb3 to look like now that you have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 and you and your husband are divorced\cb1 \
\cb3 you know\cb1 \
\cb3 the next part but i would say take high\cb1 \
\cb3 value out of the entire equation\cb1 \
\cb3 because high value is a very small\cb1 \
\cb3 segment of men\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are plenty of productive\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful men but you got\cb1 \
\cb3 to ask\cb1 \
\cb3 one question what are you bringing to\cb1 \
\cb3 the table\cb1 \
\cb3 that the kind of man that you would want\cb1 \
\cb3 what does he want\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's one thing that you ladies you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies tend to not really answer\cb1 \
\cb3 okay thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 all right um yeah ladies you're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 have to ask yourself a simple question\cb1 \
\cb3 um yeah they couldn't hear the audio it\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't don't worry about it\cb1 \
\cb3 um go ahead and mute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll re uh okay\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on tiara this second i mean no\cb1 \
\cb3 don't let me tear i just need you\cb1 \
\cb3 um all right\cb1 \
\cb3 so to the people said you couldn't hear\cb1 \
\cb3 basically she wanted to caution young\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 to marry before you carry\cb1 \
\cb3 um there's not a lot to that one\cb1 \
\cb3 because you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll i'll i'll go over later there's not\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot to that call\cb1 \
\cb3 she was just trying to give some advice\cb1 \
\cb3 that she really wasn't ready to give\cb1 \
\cb3 uh hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes first name\cb1 \
\cb3 uh um hold on hold\cb1 \
\cb3 on hold on i'll be nice to you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you be nice to me that's all i\cb1 \
\cb3 i just you want to go by lewis okay how\cb1 \
\cb3 are you\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm fine good evening\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's that's yeah you're coming\cb1 \
\cb3 into a place let's\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what do you have for me louis\cb1 \
\cb3 well i had i have a question and then i\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 make a statement my question is why are\cb1 \
\cb3 you giving\cb1 \
\cb3 women why are you shaming women who\cb1 \
\cb3 louis what you're not going to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is what you just attempted to do\cb1 \
\cb3 i said it first and i'll say it again\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll be nice to you if you're nice to me\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh if all you can use is shaming\cb1 \
\cb3 language and these kind of things\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll bid you a good night\cb1 \
\cb3 you either have a conversation like a\cb1 \
\cb3 reasonable adult\cb1 \
\cb3 or you go elsewhere\cb1 \
\cb3 now you cannot mute yourself and attempt\cb1 \
\cb3 to do this one more again\cb1 \
\cb3 i do not accept yeah i do not accept you\cb1 \
\cb3 coming in here saying\cb1 \
\cb3 shaming this no ma'am nope no ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 so what you what you're going to do is\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to be respectful of what\cb1 \
\cb3 look man i'm having to raise my voice i\cb1 \
\cb3 have pleasant conversations with\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 and because you may be what in your\cb1 \
\cb3 feelings a little upset\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not shaming anything the 5 000\cb1 \
\cb3 people who watched it\cb1 \
\cb3 so what what is your issue well thank\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 people it makes you it makes me feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like that\cb1 \
\cb3 it's making women feel shameful that\cb1 \
\cb3 they\cb1 \
\cb3 had kids by a man and\cb1 \
\cb3 that wasn't their plan for life like\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not their life\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me\cb1 \
\cb3 so say oh no\cb1 \
\cb3 this is a um how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 30. no child gets born\cb1 \
\cb3 that a woman did not want to bring to\cb1 \
\cb3 this world\cb1 \
\cb3 so so to say that i'm making them feel\cb1 \
\cb3 shameful for a choice they made\cb1 \
\cb3 no you choose to be a parent that has\cb1 \
\cb3 consequences\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think choosing to be a parent is\cb1 \
\cb3 a negative thing and\cb1 \
\cb3 i never said it was a negative thing i\cb1 \
\cb3 just said it has consequences\cb1 \
\cb3 i think where everything in life has\cb1 \
\cb3 consequences but choosing to be a parent\cb1 \
\cb3 ha okay but see what you came under\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to do is\cb1 \
\cb3 you telling women and having a child\cb1 \
\cb3 that they didn't plan or\cb1 \
\cb3 this the life didn't work it's shameful\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 life is no you didn't let me finish\cb1 \
\cb3 well because i was first there you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not you're not gonna talk over me\cb1 \
\cb3 when you come in here telling me that\cb1 \
\cb3 it's shameful what i'm doing\cb1 \
\cb3 you can say what you have to say you\cb1 \
\cb3 have 20 seconds\cb1 \
\cb3 but be respectful i'm not saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're saying is shameful i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying it will make a woman feel\cb1 \
\cb3 shameful that you're saying that because\cb1 \
\cb3 they have a kid there's no\cb1 \
\cb3 future in that for them they they can't\cb1 \
\cb3 find it they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be able to be married or get a\cb1 \
\cb3 husband\cb1 \
\cb3 no that's not what i said but i mean but\cb1 \
\cb3 let me\cb1 \
\cb3 let me make it real clear we do need to\cb1 \
\cb3 bring\cb1 \
\cb3 shame back because you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 well because here's the thing i talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about a\cb1 \
\cb3 cal a certain caliber of man and these\cb1 \
\cb3 men don't want children\cb1 \
\cb3 from another another man ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 do you not think okay do you have any\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i do you have a son uh-huh\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you so your son makes something of\cb1 \
\cb3 himself he becomes an attorney\cb1 \
\cb3 a well-regarded attorney 35 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 you want him you think that he should\cb1 \
\cb3 bring home\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman with three kids by two different\cb1 \
\cb3 dudes\cb1 \
\cb3 i think he should bring home a woman no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no see you didn't answer no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no yes no no see no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no i didn't get the [ __ ] question out\cb1 \
\cb3 of my mouth before you decide see\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i'll let you go ahead you\cb1 \
\cb3 think he should do what\cb1 \
\cb3 i think he should bring home whoever he\cb1 \
\cb3 please\cb1 \
\cb3 whoever he's happy with right just\cb1 \
\cb3 because a woman doesn't have a kid\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't mean that you're going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 happy with her\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am where's your husband i've turned\cb1 \
\cb3 down two proposals because\cb1 \
\cb3 how many children do you have i have one\cb1 \
\cb3 child\cb1 \
\cb3 okay why are you so upset that i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 telling the reality that men want\cb1 \
\cb3 men don't want women who have children\cb1 \
\cb3 by other men\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me especially productive\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 higher value men choose overwhelmingly\cb1 \
\cb3 to start their own families\cb1 \
\cb3 see what you have a problem with man is\cb1 \
\cb3 men finally saying what men have always\cb1 \
\cb3 thought\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want the downsides or\cb1 \
\cb3 consequences that come along with being\cb1 \
\cb3 a single mother\cb1 \
\cb3 get married before you have a baby i\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate the truth\cb1 \
\cb3 and the honesty um\cb1 \
\cb3 then what's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 well i mean but what's the problem with\cb1 \
\cb3 saying i just don't\cb1 \
\cb3 feel like feelings man what's the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah you cannot over talk to me you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot do that\cb1 \
\cb3 calm down and and just respond\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot mute yourself but you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is another reason\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with women with children you get\cb1 \
\cb3 overly emotional because\cb1 \
\cb3 your children are important to you but\cb1 \
\cb3 they're on but they're important to you\cb1 \
\cb3 not us you cannot mute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 wow that is not true you you can\cb1 \
\cb3 no no your children are important to\cb1 \
\cb3 you they're not important to us\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like my child is important excuse\cb1 \
\cb3 me ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 your child is important to you it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 important to us\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the here's the real question\cb1 \
\cb3 other men out in the the public not now\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me man no this ain't about me man\cb1 \
\cb3 why didn't you\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you and your why didn't you\cb1 \
\cb3 marry the man you chose to have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 he wasn't good enough for me well then\cb1 \
\cb3 that's okay so what i need you to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 on the open dating market you come into\cb1 \
\cb3 the open dating market\cb1 \
\cb3 with a baby from a man you say wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 good enough for you\cb1 \
\cb3 to us to men like myself to men with\cb1 \
\cb3 good sense\cb1 \
\cb3 that what says she is a poor judge of\cb1 \
\cb3 character\cb1 \
\cb3 because she gave a man the highest honor\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman can give any man on the planet\cb1 \
\cb3 a child and then she gave a man who\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't good enough for her\cb1 \
\cb3 a baby sorry ma'am don't get upset\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 that's great but if you agree with it\cb1 \
\cb3 then understand\cb1 \
\cb3 i agree there's a reason but i also want\cb1 \
\cb3 to say that i'm allowed to\cb1 \
\cb3 make poor judgments because well yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 you oh yeah you are but you you are\cb1 \
\cb3 stopped yeah you are but we don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 but understand something listen listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen listen you are but the\cb1 \
\cb3 world does not owe you\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding you're allowed to make you\cb1 \
\cb3 are allowed to make they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 but guess what we are going to just does\cb1 \
\cb3 it too\cb1 \
\cb3 man we all do it you don't set your\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional self down\cb1 \
\cb3 lady i'm sorry that the world is not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to continue\cb1 \
\cb3 the world ain't going to continue to\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all your child is your least of\cb1 \
\cb3 your problems\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is the kind of [ __ ] that\cb1 \
\cb3 goes on too often with women black women\cb1 \
\cb3 in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 think you know because you can get your\cb1 \
\cb3 ass up here and be emotional and talk\cb1 \
\cb3 loud\cb1 \
\cb3 it's going to overcome the fact that you\cb1 \
\cb3 made a baby with a dude that you say\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't good enough\cb1 \
\cb3 that's your problem the world does not\cb1 \
\cb3 owe you\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 and you sound like you need a whole lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of damn therapy because you're far too\cb1 \
\cb3 angry about some [ __ ] you chose to do\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make this [ __ ] up people\cb1 \
\cb3 angry ass i'm entitled to make mistakes\cb1 \
\cb3 no no\cb1 \
\cb3 you can make them but no one has to live\cb1 \
\cb3 with them with you that's why you buy\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 i've turned down proposals not by man\cb1 \
\cb3 worth anything\cb1 \
\cb3 see what it does is it youth ladies have\cb1 \
\cb3 been told\cb1 \
\cb3 that having a child is no big deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and the reality is it's a really big\cb1 \
\cb3 deal\cb1 \
\cb3 you are relegated to getting men who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't worth a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 and ain't worth [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and berlin\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yes i can\cb1 \
\cb3 no problem your first name\cb1 \
\cb3 your first name what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 amber\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so um miss louise louise whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 her name is\cb1 \
\cb3 she reminded me like she brought up a\cb1 \
\cb3 question i always wonder so women who\cb1 \
\cb3 already have children are you saying\cb1 \
\cb3 there is no potential for her to find a\cb1 \
\cb3 good man\cb1 \
\cb3 or if so like which man\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm not no i am not saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying that what i am saying is\cb1 \
\cb3 women who have\cb1 \
\cb3 children need to understand that those\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 are a liability to us men\cb1 \
\cb3 and judging a woman like you versus\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 one a woman with no children you are not\cb1 \
\cb3 equal to us\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to have to do more to\cb1 \
\cb3 compensate for the fact that you're\cb1 \
\cb3 bringing another whole human being\cb1 \
\cb3 to me to provide for and\cb1 \
\cb3 all the stuff that comes along with it\cb1 \
\cb3 let me give you an example amber how old\cb1 \
\cb3 are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 24. in the in the animal\cb1 \
\cb3 communi in the animal in in the animal\cb1 \
\cb3 kingdom\cb1 \
\cb3 if a a new alpha male or a new\cb1 \
\cb3 male takes over an existing\cb1 \
\cb3 pride or an existing group of females\cb1 \
\cb3 what does he do to the children the cubs\cb1 \
\cb3 what do they do to him so what did he\cb1 \
\cb3 just take over that family\cb1 \
\cb3 is that what you're saying yeah what is\cb1 \
\cb3 the if a male\cb1 \
\cb3 if a male lion takes over a pride of\cb1 \
\cb3 female lions and they have cubs\cb1 \
\cb3 what is the male what does the new male\cb1 \
\cb3 lion do to the kid\cb1 \
\cb3 the the cubs from other male lions what\cb1 \
\cb3 does he do to those cubs\cb1 \
\cb3 the base off the topic it seems like he\cb1 \
\cb3 won't\cb1 \
\cb3 even kill a member they kill him\cb1 \
\cb3 okay see this is why we don't seem to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand it is not in a man's nature\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 it it goes against our biological\cb1 \
\cb3 imperative to\cb1 \
\cb3 to protect provide for other men's kids\cb1 \
\cb3 all throughout the animal kingdom men\cb1 \
\cb3 kill children from other men\cb1 \
\cb3 and guess what the lionesses do sit\cb1 \
\cb3 their ass there and take it\cb1 \
\cb3 and then make new kids with the new lion\cb1 \
\cb3 this is something that we used to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 but in the last 50 years we've told\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 don't matter girl you got a job you can\cb1 \
\cb3 provide\cb1 \
\cb3 you can take care of but you cannot you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 be everything to a child you need two\cb1 \
\cb3 parents\cb1 \
\cb3 to be balanced and if you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 child it's not a death sentence but you\cb1 \
\cb3 better understand something\cb1 \
\cb3 it is going to be far more difficult to\cb1 \
\cb3 date a man especially the higher up you\cb1 \
\cb3 go\cb1 \
\cb3 the more you want that man to be\cb1 \
\cb3 productive competitive successful the\cb1 \
\cb3 higher value\cb1 \
\cb3 the better man he is the more you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to have to compensate because\cb1 \
\cb3 the competition is stiff you're\cb1 \
\cb3 competing with the women around him\cb1 \
\cb3 does that make sense okay so it does\cb1 \
\cb3 so if a woman already have children so\cb1 \
\cb3 what type of\cb1 \
\cb3 men what is her only option like what i\cb1 \
\cb3 can't demand\cb1 \
\cb3 there is nothing that's a hundred\cb1 \
\cb3 percent but here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a child i do not\cb1 \
\cb3 all right why is this important to you\cb1 \
\cb3 because i just felt like she was very\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional and i can understand\cb1 \
\cb3 what why she was but why was she\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional\cb1 \
\cb3 she was emotional because she's\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional because she knows\cb1 \
\cb3 whether she can communicate it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 that life is harder\cb1 \
\cb3 as a single mother trying to date\cb1 \
\cb3 especially the higher up man you go\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's just the world\cb1 \
\cb3 she's emotional because she's angry\cb1 \
\cb3 she's angry at the reality of the world\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's not the world's problem she\cb1 \
\cb3 lives in the world that i live in\cb1 \
\cb3 see you're only angry when you're trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to get an outcome\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can't get and you the game is\cb1 \
\cb3 rigged it's not fair\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're supposed to be married to the\cb1 \
\cb3 man who you make children with\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what's supposed to happen if you\cb1 \
\cb3 choose not to do that you deal with all\cb1 \
\cb3 the outcomes did you hear that she said\cb1 \
\cb3 i made a baby with a man who wasn't good\cb1 \
\cb3 enough\cb1 \
\cb3 yes who the [ __ ] wants to be with a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who had a baby with a man who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't good enough\cb1 \
\cb3 i agree but um i just felt like she just\cb1 \
\cb3 felt like\cb1 \
\cb3 from some reason she felt like she\cb1 \
\cb3 should be ashamed for having a child by\cb1 \
\cb3 someone she's not\cb1 \
\cb3 well well yeah you should you should\cb1 \
\cb3 my personal opinion you should because\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 we need to get to the point where we\cb1 \
\cb3 need to we we have taken shame\cb1 \
\cb3 and guilt away from the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 and look at what has gotten us\cb1 \
\cb3 this is what you have when you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman say i had a baby by a man who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't good enough\cb1 \
\cb3 what we supposed to just give a lollipop\cb1 \
\cb3 and say no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 go over there and get one of those\cb1 \
\cb3 productive competitive successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 and get him to raise the ain't [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 man's kid\cb1 \
\cb3 go put that on your brother would you\cb1 \
\cb3 want your brother to be with her\cb1 \
\cb3 and ray would you want that to be your\cb1 \
\cb3 would you want that to be your step\cb1 \
\cb3 uh nephew\cb1 \
\cb3 see i can't say because i just felt like\cb1 \
\cb3 things happened first of all black women\cb1 \
\cb3 need to stop with this future take\cb1 \
\cb3 feeling out of it\cb1 \
\cb3 it ain't about your feelings it's about\cb1 \
\cb3 practical choices\cb1 \
\cb3 would do you have a brother i do\cb1 \
\cb3 would you do you love your brother i do\cb1 \
\cb3 then why would you want your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 taking on the responsibility of a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who had a child with a man she says\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't [ __ ] and the offspring\cb1 \
\cb3 you must not love him that much if you\cb1 \
\cb3 want him to say yeah bro go take that\cb1 \
\cb3 versus going to have a woman who has no\cb1 \
\cb3 kids and make your own\cb1 \
\cb3 see he he actually has been in that\cb1 \
\cb3 situation before\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was not like a child\cb1 \
\cb3 and where's your dad where's your dad\cb1 \
\cb3 he's with my mother\cb1 \
\cb3 they've been together ever since so your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother your brother and hell is your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 um he's 34. so you're telling me your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 decided to get with a woman who had a\cb1 \
\cb3 child by duty she said ain't [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i'm not necessarily don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 and she said he's not [ __ ] but the\cb1 \
\cb3 man was not in the child's life so\cb1 \
\cb3 ultimate question\cb1 \
\cb3 is is that the best choice for your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 if he feels like the woman is best for\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 and again this is what we get then this\cb1 \
\cb3 is and this is the loop that comes with\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 we keep going back to these feelings and\cb1 \
\cb3 what it comes down to is such a lack of\cb1 \
\cb3 respect for men\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry man no other race of women\cb1 \
\cb3 would sit around and say yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and strap on the responsibility\cb1 \
\cb3 and feedback of another man's child\cb1 \
\cb3 and take that on brother other women\cb1 \
\cb3 have more respect for their men than\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna leave this in because you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make this [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot make this up\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and kevin i guess like the reason\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 i was trying to relate in a way is\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 it's hard when i see my brother and my\cb1 \
\cb3 sister in the same situation\cb1 \
\cb3 but i myself always brother your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 and your sister\cb1 \
\cb3 you're about i don't understand you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a sister yeah so my idea is my sister\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a child and her fiance has two\cb1 \
\cb3 other children as well and they're\cb1 \
\cb3 together\cb1 \
\cb3 and so here's the thing man your sister\cb1 \
\cb3 has a child and your friend and her\cb1 \
\cb3 fiance you know what i hear chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 the black community is at the bottom you\cb1 \
\cb3 know why because all this damn chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 because we do [ __ ] out of order\cb1 \
\cb3 what what are we supposed to have\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to get married before you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a kid he's supposed to stay with each\cb1 \
\cb3 other\cb1 \
\cb3 but no we we do this [ __ ] you're talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about and then you got\cb1 \
\cb3 got a 24 year old woman right here who\cb1 \
\cb3 has no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to intercede for other people\cb1 \
\cb3 this is dysfunction\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm going to leave this in this woman\cb1 \
\cb3 has no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's involved in her brother's\cb1 \
\cb3 feelings and her sister's feelings\cb1 \
\cb3 and a woman she don't know feeling all\cb1 \
\cb3 of it because it's a bunch of [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 and we got to start calling it chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 this is not healthy this is not normal\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate you calling in young lady do\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself a favor\cb1 \
\cb3 before you make babies have a husband\cb1 \
\cb3 oh that's for sure because you know why\cb1 \
\cb3 why do you know that for sure\cb1 \
\cb3 because i see it i see the frustration\cb1 \
\cb3 with myself\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly thank you because you see what\cb1 \
\cb3 it's right and\cb1 \
\cb3 we need more people like you saying i\cb1 \
\cb3 see this [ __ ] and it's not a good\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i can love them but i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 reproduce i don't want to replicate that\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the same thing i was asking the\cb1 \
\cb3 previous lady would you want your son\cb1 \
\cb3 bringing home this [ __ ] and she couldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 be honest because\cb1 \
\cb3 she was too emotional she's too close to\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 thanks appreciate it all right\cb1 \
\cb3 don you want to or d lewis you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 try to come back in and calm yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 down\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm not gonna change what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 we have made it too simple to say oh\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's too bad\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not fair she made a mistake\cb1 \
\cb3 when do we start saying okay\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you going to do about it\cb1 \

\cb3 another man\cb1 \
\cb3 and whether i like it or not whether i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand or not whether i agree or not\cb1 \
\cb3 men the men that i want the men that i\cb1 \

\cb3 man for you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the man that's right for you will\cb1 \

\cb3 [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 i listen to everybody that tells women\cb1 \
\cb3 that and i say ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 you pay attention to guy like that at\cb1 \
\cb3 your own peril they're telling you what\cb1 \
\cb3 they want you to hear so they can\cb1 \
\cb3 so you can buy what they're selling\cb1 \
\cb3 men do not typically go out checking for\cb1 \
\cb3 women with children\cb1 \
\cb3 as the default setting we don't want it\cb1 \
\cb3 hey you want to go out this weekend\cb1 \
\cb3 where i need to find a sitter\cb1 \
\cb3 how many different times do we have to\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you this ladies having a child from\cb1 \
\cb3 another man\cb1 \
\cb3 is a negative\cb1 \
\cb3 and men are tired of explaining this\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over men are kind of explaining\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over and men are tired of\cb1 \
\cb3 hearing other men lie to you and act\cb1 \
\cb3 like well\cb1 \
\cb3 if you loved you he'll accept your\cb1 \
\cb3 children that is one of the worst\cb1 \
\cb3 lies this devilish [ __ ] is that what's\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most devilish\cb1 \
\cb3 things that have ever been told to women\cb1 \
\cb3 that if if the man does not like it he\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't the right one for you\cb1 \
\cb3 that is some devilish [ __ ] in my opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 that takes all the responsibility off of\cb1 \
\cb3 the women and puts it on to the men as\cb1 \
\cb3 if the men are wrong for not wanting\cb1 \
\cb3 what's against nature\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's really bad in the black\cb1 \
\cb3 community try this and try this\cb1 \
\cb3 in korea try it in japan try it in china\cb1 \

\cb3 this uh i got something else coming\cb1 \

\cb3 don't know how to pronounce your name\cb1 \
\cb3 nepal that's not nepal\cb1 \
\cb3 come by um let's also talk about this\cb1 \
\cb3 whole high value thing a lot of people\cb1 \
\cb3 getting their feelings about high value\cb1 \
\cb3 and like it or not high value men are\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable\cb1 \
\cb3 whether you like the way i defined it or\cb1 \
\cb3 not i at least put it down and it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 vague and nebulous what i did when i\cb1 \
\cb3 defined high value is i made it special\cb1 \
\cb3 and rare\cb1 \
\cb3 so you ladies understand how how\cb1 \
\cb3 how far apart it is from most men\cb1 \
\cb3 if every man was high value no man is\cb1 \
\cb3 high value\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are plenty of people out there\cb1 \
\cb3 will tell you that a man is high value\cb1 \
\cb3 in relation to a woman that is\cb1 \
\cb3 the video is coming but uh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah ladies you got to decide who you're\cb1 \
\cb3 listening to\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't proclaim to know everything\cb1 \
\cb3 i just know what i know\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you want to have the best shot at\cb1 \
\cb3 having a healthy functioning\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 coming to it with no children is the\cb1 \
\cb3 best\cb1 \
\cb3 option\cb1 \
\cb3 if you do have a child you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 have to let you're going to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that men are going to have to decide\cb1 \
\cb3 whether or not they want to accept it or\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 and more men are going to reject it long\cb1 \
\cb3 term than accept it they'll\cb1 \
\cb3 say they're accepting it just to get in\cb1 \
\cb3 hit and leave\cb1 \
\cb3 but you ask your male friends ask men\cb1 \
\cb3 and your family\cb1 \
\cb3 would you choose to go out and marry\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman who has children from another\cb1 \
\cb3 man not\cb1 \
\cb3 date not deal with kick it ask men that\cb1 \
\cb3 you respect would you\cb1 \
\cb3 choose to go out and marry a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 has children\cb1 \
\cb3 from another man and watch what they\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 all right till the next time\cb1 \

\cb3 longer stays over 50 you don't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 worry about hearing that loud\cb1 \
\cb3 intermission song that sounds like this\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want to hear that song\cb1 \
\cb3 i know a lot of y'all don't want to hear\cb1 \
\cb3 that sound but uh\cb1 \
\cb3 i know some people actually have grown\cb1 \
\cb3 to like it i know you still like it\cb1 \
\cb3 doctor\cb1 \
\cb3 doc says she still like it\cb1 \
\cb3 uh it's all good i know many people have\cb1 \
\cb3 grown to like it\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm gonna tell you this we have\cb1 \
\cb3 grown this trailer we've grown this\cb1 \
\cb3 platform we've grown this movement\cb1 \
\cb3 because if nothing else we have become\cb1 \
\cb3 to start having conversations that are\cb1 \
\cb3 not happening\cb1 \
\cb3 other places um yes i've realized that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know high value this or high value\cb1 \
\cb3 that has\cb1 \
\cb3 taken you know on a life of its own and\cb1 \
\cb3 i will be responding to some of my\cb1 \
\cb3 latest high value critics\cb1 \
\cb3 even though you know i endeavor to stay\cb1 \
\cb3 out of beefs and squabbles\cb1 \
\cb3 and back and forth but you know good\cb1 \
\cb3 people can disagree\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's how you disagree that matters a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot as a\cb1 \
\cb3 man especially a man of value enough\cb1 \
\cb3 substance\cb1 \
\cb3 more on that later you see the title in\cb1 \
\cb3 the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 you see the title of the video she still\cb1 \
\cb3 thinks she's the schnitz\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah we got a lot of noise going on over\cb1 \
\cb3 here guys you know\cb1 \
\cb3 uh la is about to go on another um\cb1 \
\cb3 curfew so people are getting all their\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 in and i ain't mad at them by the time\cb1 \
\cb3 they go on curfew\cb1 \
\cb3 i would be up out of this piece uh so i\cb1 \
\cb3 think a lot of folks are just kind of\cb1 \
\cb3 doing what they do so that's what about\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on just a second\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so well we're not going to\cb1 \
\cb3 worry about it\cb1 \
\cb3 as la is about to go on la uh curfew\cb1 \
\cb3 on saturday la is\cb1 \
\cb3 been a great trip but i realized that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm much more of a new york city guy\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm much more of a coast guard uh but\cb1 \
\cb3 why do i want to do this show today\cb1 \
\cb3 why do i want to do this show today baby\cb1 \
\cb3 mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 who still think they're the stuff and i\cb1 \
\cb3 need to speak\cb1 \
\cb3 about a particular subset of women\cb1 \
\cb3 they fall into that adjustable six\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh closer to the eight ver the\cb1 \
\cb3 closer to the eight\cb1 \
\cb3 range of the adjustable six not closer\cb1 \
\cb3 to the six range\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable six for those of you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 know when i\cb1 \
\cb3 uh rank people rate women i don't use\cb1 \
\cb3 sevens because\cb1 \
\cb3 my reasons you're either a six which is\cb1 \
\cb3 cute\cb1 \
\cb3 or you're an eight which is pretty seven\cb1 \
\cb3 allows too much gray area for many\cb1 \
\cb3 people\cb1 \
\cb3 and an adjustable six is a woman who is\cb1 \
\cb3 walks around and she's cute and on any\cb1 \
\cb3 given sunday she can decide that she\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to be pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 and all she has to do is put some you\cb1 \
\cb3 know do yourself up\cb1 \
\cb3 as it were adjustable sixes\cb1 \
\cb3 eights nines and tens that's who we're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to talk about today\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable sixes eights nines and tens\cb1 \
\cb3 these are the women who get a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 they're used to getting attention\cb1 \
\cb3 they're used to having getting their\cb1 \
\cb3 pick of the litter they're used to guys\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to highlight them try to record\cb1 \
\cb3 them because they look good\cb1 \
\cb3 and it has always been that way even\cb1 \
\cb3 before social media\cb1 \
\cb3 it has been that way okay\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the these are the women who were\cb1 \
\cb3 like the head cheerleader\cb1 \
\cb3 the it girl all those women\cb1 \
\cb3 and her posse that she hung with we're\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about women\cb1 \
\cb3 that even if you had to play the wingman\cb1 \
\cb3 you still weren't coming up short\cb1 \
\cb3 by hollandaise vanessa you know\cb1 \
\cb3 there was cheryl there's joanne there's\cb1 \

\cb3 everybody wants sheila oh she loves\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody wanted sheila [ __ ] it was a\cb1 \
\cb3 bad one\cb1 \
\cb3 and only certain kind of men could\cb1 \
\cb3 get the sheilas of the world but\cb1 \
\cb3 if you happen to get her cousin or her\cb1 \
\cb3 friend vanessa\cb1 \
\cb3 vanessa was no slouch\cb1 \
\cb3 and often vanessa wins more than sheila\cb1 \
\cb3 because vanessa had to work harder\cb1 \
\cb3 but here's what we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 women who are adjustable sixes\cb1 \
\cb3 at least cute we're talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 thelma on good times range\cb1 \

\cb3 tina decided to start dealing with bums\cb1 \
\cb3 losers deadbeats guys who were not\cb1 \
\cb3 on her level\cb1 \
\cb3 and he may have put it on her whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 whatever whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 the guy she chose to kick it with\cb1 \
\cb3 she just threw caution to the wind and\cb1 \
\cb3 allowed him to go in there\cb1 \

\cb3 see that makes it real clear because\cb1 \
\cb3 you've had\cb1 \
\cb3 everything up to that point anyway right\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been engaged right i don't count\cb1 \
\cb3 those either\cb1 \
\cb3 been engaged remember we don't count\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with remember one of the best\cb1 \
\cb3 things i ever gave you guys and when you\cb1 \
\cb3 latest we don't deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with can deal with can deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 engagements pretty women\cb1 \
\cb3 are some of the most engaged unmarried\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty sadly\cb1 \
\cb3 cute pretty beautiful african-american\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 tend to be some of the prettiest\cb1 \
\cb3 engaged but unwifed women\cb1 \
\cb3 more on that later because women\cb1 \
\cb3 especially a lot of black women\cb1 \
\cb3 have been engaged for a long time three\cb1 \
\cb3 four five engagements see when you make\cb1 \
\cb3 it real clear\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a high value man or whatever you\cb1 \
\cb3 do whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 term you're using has any one of them\cb1 \
\cb3 marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the answer is no\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's what i say it's the dating\cb1 \
\cb3 market is difficult because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not an unattractive woman sure a\cb1 \
\cb3 guy will take you out for a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice date\cb1 \
\cb3 you really know what you really want to\cb1 \
\cb3 know what you think\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 get my lights up\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Applause]\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 uh\cb1 \
\cb3 uh we got 200 300 more to go\cb1 \
\cb3 300 more to go\cb1 \
\cb3 it should be at least 1700\cb1 \
\cb3 we will go to round two if we need to\cb1 \
\cb3 guys\cb1 \
\cb3 all right man how tall are you keep\cb1 \
\cb3 doing it\cb1 \
\cb3 five six i weigh 115 pounds yes oh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll take you out i'll tell you i would\cb1 \
\cb3 take you\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i don't have a problem finding men of\cb1 \
\cb3 course not i wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 but the thing is but what do you find in\cb1 \
\cb3 the four though\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah and this is where the disconnect\cb1 \
\cb3 tends to be\cb1 \
\cb3 i never probably find him in depending\cb1 \
\cb3 on the date yeah but the only thing\cb1 \
\cb3 the thing that men will take you out for\cb1 \
\cb3 with your cute self\cb1 \
\cb3 is sex\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what the caller was saying why\cb1 \
\cb3 all the good men it we're all the men\cb1 \
\cb3 who want relationships in marriage\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't get them because you chose to\cb1 \
\cb3 have a baby before you got married for\cb1 \
\cb3 one\cb1 \
\cb3 two different times and you are still\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to date\cb1 \
\cb3 based on your looks thinking you're\cb1 \
\cb3 still the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're not those children\cb1 \
\cb3 cost you but you can't tell a lot of\cb1 \
\cb3 baby mamas especially\cb1 \
\cb3 women that remember the days where they\cb1 \
\cb3 got into vip for free\cb1 \
\cb3 the days where they were getting fluid\cb1 \
\cb3 out and everything else they think that\cb1 \
\cb3 this will happen so often with\cb1 \
\cb3 adjustable sixes and eights even let's\cb1 \
\cb3 get let's get it right out to the eights\cb1 \
\cb3 and nines\cb1 \
\cb3 eights nines and tens who used to be the\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 you are no longer this you are no longer\cb1 \
\cb3 the stuff after you have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're still trying to get out here\cb1 \
\cb3 and date and negotiate\cb1 \
\cb3 as if you're still hot stuff and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll take you out take you out get you a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice steak and some lobster\cb1 \
\cb3 we'd have a good old time and i would\cb1 \
\cb3 blow your\cb1 \
\cb3 back out but i wouldn't marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 see now i want to be clear i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 to this person\cb1 \
\cb3 because she's asking a question and\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to help you lady\cb1 \
\cb3 that's i'm not speaking for me i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 speaking for men in general\cb1 \
\cb3 wait to how you see how this story ends\cb1 \
\cb3 because a lot i had many women saying oh\cb1 \
\cb3 you were so mean to her\cb1 \
\cb3 you were so that was so harsh she's so\cb1 \
\cb3 misunderstood\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i never do anything without\cb1 \
\cb3 having a reason\cb1 \
\cb3 and the point was ma'am you don't seem\cb1 \
\cb3 to get it\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids means you can't get what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't get what you used to get\cb1 \
\cb3 what i think i really have an issue is\cb1 \
\cb3 like\cb1 \
\cb3 finding men that don't want like the\cb1 \
\cb3 superficial like most i feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 the type of guys like they just want a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman that like\cb1 \
\cb3 looks good on their arm like yes\cb1 \
\cb3 now remember this part too this is a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who came in\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a mother of two kids and i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 career woman and my kids are beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 and gorgeous and well-behaved and\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want a man who's just into this\cb1 \
\cb3 petty superficial stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 oh you can't make this stuff up i want\cb1 \
\cb3 more\cb1 \
\cb3 i want hmm\cb1 \
\cb3 oh you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 so like when you don't listen let me\cb1 \
\cb3 stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop\cb1 \
\cb3 stop right there yes that's what we want\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's who we are\cb1 \
\cb3 and you want a man that's the problem i\cb1 \
\cb3 have with david but listen listen listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen yeah the problem she has with\cb1 \
\cb3 dating is the men want beautiful women\cb1 \
\cb3 who don't have children\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem and again right thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 roxy sin\cb1 \
\cb3 riding on the pretty here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 you wasted pretty babe\cb1 \
\cb3 you wasted it pretty and as i said\cb1 \
\cb3 further it ain't just a pro\cb1 \
\cb3 it ain't just the men aren't the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 look at how many women call into this\cb1 \
\cb3 show trying to understand what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on with men and why are men\cb1 \
\cb3 no ma'am more you ladies need take\cb1 \
\cb3 accountability be honest with yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 and accept what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 you want men not to be men you want men\cb1 \
\cb3 to think\cb1 \
\cb3 like women that's not what we value\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 we want a beautiful woman on our arm\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah that's the problem well\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 yes did you hear this woman\cb1 \
\cb3 we want a woman a beautiful woman on her\cb1 \
\cb3 arm\cb1 \
\cb3 and she actually had the nerve to say\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 so guess what to the men of the world\cb1 \
\cb3 all 3.5 billion of you you're the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem\cb1 \
\cb3 not her not a woman who not women who\cb1 \
\cb3 decide to go out and do what they do\cb1 \
\cb3 fine you can do that\cb1 \
\cb3 but then you want to come back and judge\cb1 \
\cb3 you for wanting what you want\cb1 \
\cb3 why because pretty privilege is the\cb1 \
\cb3 business\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty pretty baby mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 are a special breed because they really\cb1 \
\cb3 still think they are the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 you're the problem because i'm telling\cb1 \
\cb3 you what men\cb1 \
\cb3 want you've experienced what men want\cb1 \
\cb3 and you've got a problem with it that's\cb1 \
\cb3 your problem we're not going to change\cb1 \
\cb3 you're either going to get on board with\cb1 \
\cb3 it or you will die alone\cb1 \
\cb3 so what should i be looking for then\cb1 \
\cb3 well\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly first you need to get down and\cb1 \
\cb3 understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 you have no leverage you have no\cb1 \
\cb3 leverage in this matter\cb1 \
\cb3 it's the men we control access to\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships you control access to sex\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to understand what a man that\cb1 \
\cb3 you would want\cb1 \
\cb3 what he would want in a girlfriend wife\cb1 \
\cb3 or significant other\cb1 \
\cb3 like a good like a good mother\cb1 \
\cb3 that changes from every man that changes\cb1 \
\cb3 from man to man\cb1 \
\cb3 where's your father oh i don't i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't grow up with a mother or a\cb1 \
\cb3 father all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 due respect you you you've you you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 derek if that is you in the chat room\cb1 \
\cb3 because the avatar looks like yours but\cb1 \
\cb3 there's no check mark\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking me how is she the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 sit back and listen to the video but\cb1 \
\cb3 there's an entire video\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yeah i don't know if this is really\cb1 \
\cb3 your account or not\cb1 \
\cb3 how is she the problem though pay\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't seem to get that\cb1 \
\cb3 men judge the way we judge and yes like\cb1 \
\cb3 i said you have no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 getting men to pay you attention you've\cb1 \
\cb3 got no\cb1 \
\cb3 problem attracting men but getting a man\cb1 \
\cb3 to take you\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously and would you like to be\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 would okay and that's a problem because\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking a man to become a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking let's say you're asking me\cb1 \
\cb3 to come in and take care of one man's\cb1 \
\cb3 child\cb1 \
\cb3 a man's two children\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't create those it's all downside\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been a stepfather it's a\cb1 \
\cb3 horrible deal what about the men that\cb1 \
\cb3 have children of their own\cb1 \
\cb3 they want a stepmother\cb1 \
\cb3 well again you still act as though\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 listening okay listen i'll answer it\cb1 \
\cb3 see you still you're still speaking as\cb1 \
\cb3 if you have leverage in this thing\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm trying to level set you\cb1 \
\cb3 even if i have children i got more\cb1 \
\cb3 options than you\cb1 \
\cb3 i can go find a woman with no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 because i can afford both of you\cb1 \
\cb3 if i can afford if i can afford to take\cb1 \
\cb3 care of you and your\cb1 \
\cb3 patrol account or not how is she the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 is walking out into a dating market\cb1 \
\cb3 blaming men for wanting what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 see we are all\cb1 \
\cb3 we have far too many people telling\cb1 \
\cb3 women you can have your standards girl\cb1 \
\cb3 have your standards set your standards\cb1 \
\cb3 high you can be a queen\cb1 \
\cb3 this that such and so forth and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 fine guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 men have them too and we don't tell the\cb1 \
\cb3 complete story\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem because you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman out here with one\cb1 \
\cb3 two children faulting men\cb1 \
\cb3 for having standards faulty men for\cb1 \
\cb3 wanting what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet they can they can want whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 they want from me and if you pay\cb1 \
\cb3 attention\cb1 \
\cb3 you will hear this woman go into how she\cb1 \
\cb3 wants\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 kids i can afford to take care of her\cb1 \
\cb3 and no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah why would i pick you and your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 when i know your kids are\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to i'm not their father\cb1 \
\cb3 they'll never look at me as their father\cb1 \
\cb3 i got all the responsibility and none of\cb1 \
\cb3 the upside of being a biological father\cb1 \
\cb3 can i discipline those children like\cb1 \
\cb3 they were my own\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't need to discipline their\cb1 \
\cb3 brains i see that's your pro\cb1 \
\cb3 problem number one she's got kids that\cb1 \
\cb3 she doesn't want anybody to discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 because they don't need discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem now\cb1 \
\cb3 because i happen to be really good at\cb1 \
\cb3 what i do\cb1 \
\cb3 and i do this in real life because i do\cb1 \
\cb3 go back and forth to people\cb1 \
\cb3 in real time every night i'm pretty good\cb1 \
\cb3 at analyzing reading and adjusting\cb1 \
\cb3 so maybe i don't know everything but i\cb1 \
\cb3 see a pattern\cb1 \
\cb3 an entitled self-absorbed person who\cb1 \
\cb3 wants what she wants\cb1 \
\cb3 but doesn't want people to want what\cb1 \
\cb3 they want i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem and we need to start\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women it's a problem because men\cb1 \
\cb3 aren't accepting it\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not a problem then why didn't she\cb1 \
\cb3 marry the guy that she had won two kids\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a problem we act as though what\cb1 \
\cb3 women can do with anything they want to\cb1 \
\cb3 and no one's supposed to say anything\cb1 \
\cb3 and if you do you're toxic\cb1 \
\cb3 you're build your bullying your your\cb1 \
\cb3 your toxic masculine that is bs\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women there's no fault in the\cb1 \
\cb3 things they do does not\cb1 \
\cb3 help women i have women here call every\cb1 \
\cb3 night say you know when i first started\cb1 \
\cb3 listening i didn't like you\cb1 \
\cb3 but now i'm a better wife i'm a better\cb1 \
\cb3 mother\cb1 \
\cb3 go through my catalog i stand by my work\cb1 \
\cb3 because it happens every day monday\cb1 \
\cb3 through friday\cb1 \
\cb3 live you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 um there you go right there she said\cb1 \
\cb3 they don't need this\cb1 \
\cb3 okay this is why this is why shh\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't think children your kids\cb1 \
\cb3 are not special\cb1 \
\cb3 they need discipline just like anyone\cb1 \
\cb3 else maybe you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't okay then this is the problem i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need they don't need discipline so\cb1 \
\cb3 the answer is\cb1 \
\cb3 could i could i discipline the child\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 okay without without quit without you\cb1 \
\cb3 questioning me\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah if i'm like if i choose you as my\cb1 \
\cb3 partner like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm have complete trust in you okay so i\cb1 \
\cb3 got so i could so i could spank the\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 attend they don't need spain no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 i\cb1 \
\cb3 could spend you see how that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 how she's\cb1 \
\cb3 quickly say yes you can just if i choose\cb1 \
\cb3 you of my partner as\cb1 \
\cb3 being of dual minds saying stuff that\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't mean is a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 because if a man says something he\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't believe we call him a liar\cb1 \
\cb3 we call him unstable foundation unset\cb1 \
\cb3 we're talking about a woman with one two\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 i expect women to be what they say they\cb1 \
\cb3 are\cb1 \
\cb3 adults did see\cb1 \
\cb3 see right there i said i can discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 children you said yes\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention to woman i am\cb1 \
\cb3 you said i could discipline the children\cb1 \
\cb3 without you questioning me\cb1 \
\cb3 yes so if i decide to spank them i gotta\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to your mouth\cb1 \
\cb3 cause they don't need it that's why you\cb1 \
\cb3 need to stay single until your kids are\cb1 \
\cb3 gone\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the choice you made when you\cb1 \
\cb3 reproduced ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 and and i have a question why don't more\cb1 \
\cb3 of you why don't more people tell women\cb1 \
\cb3 this\cb1 \
\cb3 you decided you chose no child gets born\cb1 \
\cb3 in 2000\cb1 \
\cb3 no child gets born today that was not\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning there are too many forms of\cb1 \
\cb3 birth control prior to conception and\cb1 \
\cb3 too many options post conception\cb1 \
\cb3 no woman is forced to have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 so i don't give women outs for choosing\cb1 \
\cb3 when a life is born and when you choose\cb1 \
\cb3 that you choose everything that comes\cb1 \
\cb3 along with it but not enough people tell\cb1 \
\cb3 women that guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 you choosing to do that is fine but you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't\cb1 \
\cb3 but you gonna either need to accept\cb1 \
\cb3 everything that comes along with it the\cb1 \
\cb3 ups and the downs\cb1 \
\cb3 especially if you're not gonna be\cb1 \
\cb3 married to the father\cb1 \
\cb3 and know that it's going to hurt you in\cb1 \
\cb3 the open dating market because no one\cb1 \
\cb3 the world doesn't owe you acceptance or\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 and if that's too much for you if you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't want anybody to be\cb1 \
\cb3 cope don't want anybody to deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 your kids whatever then sit it out\cb1 \
\cb3 see we are good to tell men stay in your\cb1 \
\cb3 lane do better improve\cb1 \
\cb3 but guess what more we we are finally\cb1 \
\cb3 starting to have a conversation with\cb1 \
\cb3 women because what they're realizing\cb1 \
\cb3 is all this feel good prosperity\cb1 \
\cb3 preaching this\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't nothing wrong with you queen ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 working\cb1 \
\cb3 they look on their left finger and they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't have a ring\cb1 \
\cb3 a wedding ring from a man of value that\cb1 \
\cb3 they respect\cb1 \
\cb3 it may feel good to hear it but it ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 getting them where they want\cb1 \
\cb3 i need you ladies to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something you going out here having\cb1 \
\cb3 babies without marriage and then\cb1 \
\cb3 breaking up with men\cb1 \
\cb3 you incur consequences we don't want\cb1 \
\cb3 those kids around us because we cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 take care of them\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot discipline them we don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 put up with all this other stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 you're a fun woman guys look at you and\cb1 \
\cb3 be like she's got two kids and she's\cb1 \
\cb3 5 6 115 she's a lot of fun she's\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously sexually active i'll have a\cb1 \
\cb3 good time with you but no way\cb1 \
\cb3 not no not no way but very unlikely the\cb1 \
\cb3 man is going to take you seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 especially when you start talking\cb1 \
\cb3 so now for all the men\cb1 \
\cb3 recognize the truth of what i just said\cb1 \
\cb3 is you could be as pretty as you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 but talking about a man of consequence\cb1 \
\cb3 taking you seriously the chances are\cb1 \
\cb3 slim\cb1 \
\cb3 to none why is that such an\cb1 \
\cb3 issue telling women that you chose to be\cb1 \
\cb3 a mother once and twice\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 why is that such a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 instead of saying well you know whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 queen\cb1 \
\cb3 you can do what you want queen because\cb1 \
\cb3 no one's marrying these queens\cb1 \
\cb3 when her lament off the rip but she\cb1 \
\cb3 can't find anyone\cb1 \
\cb3 of consequence to be serious with\cb1 \
\cb3 oh it gets better\cb1 \
\cb3 because i believe what you're telling me\cb1 \
\cb3 is honestly and i'm like who wants this\cb1 \
\cb3 deal\cb1 \
\cb3 who doesn't want this deal a beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 that is a great mother has a great\cb1 \
\cb3 career\cb1 \
\cb3 um who doesn't want this deal listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 what she said this is her selling point\cb1 \
\cb3 a beautiful woman\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the next selling point a great\cb1 \
\cb3 mother we don't give a snot\cb1 \
\cb3 those aren't our kids ma'am being a\cb1 \
\cb3 great mother\cb1 \
\cb3 does not make you the stuff out here\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 the baby daddy didn't value it enough\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am or i should still be with him\cb1 \
\cb3 so if the man who shot up the club and\cb1 \
\cb3 gave you two children\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't value it enough to keep it why do\cb1 \
\cb3 you expect us to\cb1 \
\cb3 again she led with the beauty because\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what you got\cb1 \
\cb3 good for you but you're not still the\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 a beautiful a a a great mother which is\cb1 \
\cb3 subjective\cb1 \
\cb3 you can say you're a great mother uh i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 the jury's out on it but anybody who's\cb1 \
\cb3 talking about kids don't need\cb1 \
\cb3 disciplining\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't want to be anywhere around those\cb1 \
\cb3 kids have you ever been around people\cb1 \
\cb3 who don't discipline their children\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't i don't know many men of\cb1 \
\cb3 consequence who want to deal with that\cb1 \
\cb3 then what is next thing she said i'm a\cb1 \
\cb3 phd your career\cb1 \
\cb3 two of the three two of the three things\cb1 \
\cb3 she put out there\cb1 \
\cb3 as her selling points we don't give a\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] about\cb1 \
\cb3 oh don't care about don't care about\cb1 \
\cb3 your career strong\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm submissive nobody but listen\cb1 \
\cb3 did you\cb1 \
\cb3 did you hear what i just said did you\cb1 \
\cb3 just okay did you hear what i just said\cb1 \
\cb3 don't care about your career\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah the thing is ma'am it's the two\cb1 \
\cb3 kids\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the two remember she classified\cb1 \
\cb3 herself the strongest\cb1 \
\cb3 and not she's uh not strong but she's\cb1 \
\cb3 submissive remember that\cb1 \
\cb3 kids everything you're saying does not\cb1 \
\cb3 overcome the deficit that two children\cb1 \
\cb3 bring\cb1 \
\cb3 if you if i mean like you have money\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't matter to you\cb1 \
\cb3 i said you have money that doesn't\cb1 \

\cb3 see-saw\cb1 \
\cb3 beauty education\cb1 \
\cb3 income even if we rated those things\cb1 \
\cb3 children boom\cb1 \
\cb3 how much would you have to put on this\cb1 \
\cb3 side to overcome\cb1 \

\cb3 have them having to\cb1 \
\cb3 make a choice other than filling their\cb1 \
\cb3 head up with stuff\cb1 \

\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i yeah i i always have options i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 going to\cb1 \
\cb3 listen to how i always have options\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why you should be very careful\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with women with children\cb1 \
\cb3 especially pretty ones\cb1 \
\cb3 pay attention gentlemen\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies this may not be you but it's\cb1 \
\cb3 likely one of your home girls\cb1 \
\cb3 ask you one more time and if you are\cb1 \
\cb3 vague i'm going to bid you a good night\cb1 \
\cb3 just asking you are you dating someone\cb1 \
\cb3 seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah how long have you guys been seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 one another\cb1 \
\cb3 um it's been like two years two\cb1 \
\cb3 years has he expressed\cb1 \
\cb3 any desire to make you his wife\cb1 \
\cb3 yes has he taken you ring shopping in\cb1 \
\cb3 the last\cb1 \
\cb3 two years now remember this woman came\cb1 \
\cb3 on here talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 dating in l.a\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's claiming that she's had a\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship with somebody for two years\cb1 \
\cb3 and the man wants to marry her if we\cb1 \
\cb3 flipped that\cb1 \
\cb3 and made it a man\cb1 \
\cb3 if we made her a man and made that a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman on the other end of two years\cb1 \
\cb3 what would we call him what would the\cb1 \
\cb3 world call him\cb1 \
\cb3 see no he'd be all kind of dogs all kind\cb1 \
\cb3 of he'd be all kind of pejoratives\cb1 \
\cb3 but yeah she's just as cowsy i got\cb1 \
\cb3 options and i got somebody who wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 marry me i've been doing one for two\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 but i would rather get some oh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 how's she the problem really\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you not see this oh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah i almost went there we've been ring\cb1 \
\cb3 shopping yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 when about three months ago\cb1 \
\cb3 three months ago she went ring shopping\cb1 \
\cb3 with him\cb1 \
\cb3 she allowed me to take her room shopping\cb1 \
\cb3 this ain't the guy that\cb1 \
\cb3 like really just like sparks like\cb1 \
\cb3 two years my i don't know it just\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't feel like\cb1 \
\cb3 someone i want to be with forever so\cb1 \
\cb3 two years let him take a ring shopping\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously if you think he's not done\cb1 \
\cb3 something for her and her children\cb1 \
\cb3 you'd be foolish now\cb1 \
\cb3 who would say this woman would she i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 beautiful\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a a great mother great career does\cb1 \
\cb3 she sound like the kind of person you'd\cb1 \
\cb3 want to deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 who would like to be the man who doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 know\cb1 \
\cb3 she was on this podcast or this show\cb1 \
\cb3 who would like to be the guy she's\cb1 \
\cb3 texting hey hey big head hey good\cb1 \
\cb3 morning\cb1 \
\cb3 who would who would like to be that\cb1 \
\cb3 cluck\cb1 \
\cb3 that simp that lick\cb1 \
\cb3 that she's playing\cb1 \
\cb3 we see we have no problem when women do\cb1 \
\cb3 it to men\cb1 \
\cb3 oh but over here we call it out because\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make women perpetual victims\cb1 \
\cb3 for choices they make\cb1 \
\cb3 but you're asking what the problem is\cb1 \
\cb3 so i go back to the first thing i asked\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 are you telling me you are seeing\cb1 \
\cb3 someone then they're the man who's\cb1 \
\cb3 actually\cb1 \
\cb3 considering you is the man you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be with\cb1 \
\cb3 and you said i've got options and you\cb1 \
\cb3 just went through this\cb1 \
\cb3 convoluted way of getting back down to i\cb1 \
\cb3 got somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 playing my love life well well no ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 what it is is it's hard for you to deal\cb1 \
\cb3 with the truth what it is is\cb1 \
\cb3 one you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 a man that you want considering you\cb1 \
\cb3 to be his wife you got\cb1 \
\cb3 hard to explain her love life no no it's\cb1 \
\cb3 really not\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm going to explain it really easily\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not the [ __ ] you still think you\cb1 \
\cb3 are but you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 and you have yet to reconcile that and\cb1 \
\cb3 come to reality\cb1 \
\cb3 you're still walking around here\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking you're the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 man that you don't want who sounds like\cb1 \
\cb3 he would take you\cb1 \
\cb3 but you don't want to marry him that's\cb1 \
\cb3 why it's been two years\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why you're on here trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 figure it out and i'm only trying to\cb1 \
\cb3 help you but it seems like you'd rather\cb1 \
\cb3 argue or be right than listen no i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to argue\cb1 \
\cb3 okay well then i need you to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that your children are a massive\cb1 \
\cb3 impediment\cb1 \
\cb3 how about this would you like to have\cb1 \
\cb3 additional children i\cb1 \
\cb3 would how many oh\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe two one to two so let's say you\cb1 \
\cb3 and i were to get married\cb1 \
\cb3 okay what you automatically set up\cb1 \
\cb3 is you get pregnant on our wedding night\cb1 \
\cb3 and you get preg and you give birth to\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin junior\cb1 \
\cb3 then a year or a year after that you\cb1 \
\cb3 give birth to\cb1 \
\cb3 kim kevin and kim are my biological\cb1 \
\cb3 children with you right\cb1 \
\cb3 okay then i still have to take care of\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 two other children right so we have four\cb1 \
\cb3 four kids in the house yeah kevin and\cb1 \
\cb3 kim\cb1 \
\cb3 are mine if i decide to spank kevin you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't say [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 to me because he's mine biologically you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't tell me\cb1 \
\cb3 listen okay you're going to sit there\cb1 \
\cb3 and zip your mouth and let me get\cb1 \
\cb3 through the example before you say\cb1 \
\cb3 something can you do that give me a\cb1 \
\cb3 minute\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin and cam are mine they're my\cb1 \
\cb3 financial responsibility and you cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 pull the mommy card on me because\cb1 \
\cb3 biologically you can't you can't one-up\cb1 \
\cb3 me you can't play the high joker\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't say these um those aren't but\cb1 \
\cb3 when it comes to your children\cb1 \
\cb3 they're your children i've got to\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline them\cb1 \
\cb3 in line with what you think is right so\cb1 \
\cb3 i got\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids two sets of kids in the house\cb1 \
\cb3 under two sets of rules\cb1 \
\cb3 that's madness i've seen it\cb1 \
\cb3 no one men don't want that ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 can you understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the problem with being a having\cb1 \
\cb3 children already\cb1 \
\cb3 because you would have two kids by me\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids over here\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet if they want to go to college\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm still supposed to pay for it if your\cb1 \
\cb3 children want to go to college i still i\cb1 \
\cb3 got to put a roof over their head\cb1 \
\cb3 food in their bellies and provide for\cb1 \
\cb3 them just like i was providing for kevin\cb1 \
\cb3 and kim\cb1 \
\cb3 except this is ultimately the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 with being a woman with children\cb1 \
\cb3 i have been a stepfather i know\cb1 \
\cb3 i know of what i speak and if you look\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies if you honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 think that men don't realize\cb1 \
\cb3 especially in today's world with access\cb1 \
\cb3 to all the information we have\cb1 \
\cb3 that this is what's likely going to meet\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 as a potential step parent you're\cb1 \
\cb3 kidding yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 women with children should be in my\cb1 \
\cb3 personal opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 should be doing far more effort on\cb1 \
\cb3 increasing and improving and overcoming\cb1 \
\cb3 the liability or deficit that they bring\cb1 \
\cb3 to the table with just children\cb1 \
\cb3 and but the thing is we're not supposed\cb1 \
\cb3 to say that\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not supposed to say that because\cb1 \
\cb3 it's but the reality is\cb1 \
\cb3 it is still there\cb1 \
\cb3 go to the asian community uh you not\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing a bunch of baby mamas getting\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why they don't have a lot of them\cb1 \
\cb3 we have normalized this\cb1 \
\cb3 but now the pendulum is swinging back\cb1 \
\cb3 the other way\cb1 \
\cb3 and you're starting to see pretty baby\cb1 \
\cb3 mamas\cb1 \
\cb3 still out here trying to figure out\cb1 \
\cb3 what's wrong with men\cb1 \
\cb3 is that men are the problem kevin and\cb1 \
\cb3 kim\cb1 \
\cb3 let's say you and i divorced oh yeah by\cb1 \
\cb3 the way\cb1 \
\cb3 uh you you can leave my channel too man\cb1 \
\cb3 enough\cb1 \
\cb3 kevin and kim are mine i still got\cb1 \
\cb3 visitation\cb1 \
\cb3 do i necessarily have anything with\cb1 \
\cb3 those kids if you decide not to\cb1 \
\cb3 let me see my step kids you could cut\cb1 \
\cb3 that bond\cb1 \
\cb3 you ladies never think of it from a\cb1 \
\cb3 man's side it's all what\cb1 \
\cb3 you want and like you said you want a\cb1 \
\cb3 man to not be into all this superficial\cb1 \
\cb3 stuff another day\cb1 \
\cb3 which means you really don't give a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 what we think\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's another problem\cb1 \
\cb3 they women tend to think about it from\cb1 \
\cb3 what they want\cb1 \
\cb3 their side they don't really care to\cb1 \
\cb3 think what men\cb1 \
\cb3 want or from our side\cb1 \
\cb3 but it's not getting them the outcomes\cb1 \
\cb3 they want so\cb1 \
\cb3 like what i say how i say it like my\cb1 \
\cb3 methods dislike my methods it doesn't\cb1 \
\cb3 matter\cb1 \
\cb3 the outcome and i try my best to\cb1 \
\cb3 actually bring her to up to speed with\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on in the real world\cb1 \
\cb3 but we'll see we're just supposed to\cb1 \
\cb3 come in and do what you need\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fine but you better be offering a\cb1 \
\cb3 hell of a deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and i do have to hear that only because\cb1 \
\cb3 of the kids\cb1 \
\cb3 well the kids are big man they are big\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean here's the thing you do have the\cb1 \
\cb3 option\cb1 \
\cb3 because you say only cause of the kids\cb1 \
\cb3 but that's a big deal\cb1 \
\cb3 would you date oh so you dating a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 with children is like off the table for\cb1 \
\cb3 you i married a woman with a child ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 i understand what i'm talking about am i\cb1 \
\cb3 just doing\cb1 \
\cb3 no i would not dated one more the child\cb1 \
\cb3 no i wouldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been there and the thing is where's\cb1 \
\cb3 the children's father\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i left him where is he alive\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah is he involved in the children's\cb1 \
\cb3 life at all\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah then if you really are serious\cb1 \
\cb3 give custody to the father go off with\cb1 \
\cb3 your go\cb1 \
\cb3 off with your new husband and make a\cb1 \
\cb3 natasha graham\cb1 \
\cb3 asks why would you spank a child that is\cb1 \
\cb3 not yours\cb1 \
\cb3 seems like a mental issue to me\cb1 \
\cb3 um i want you guys to let that marinate\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody stop what you're doing to look\cb1 \
\cb3 at natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 shout out to o'shea i'm gonna use\cb1 \
\cb3 something don't say nothing to her just\cb1 \
\cb3 look at natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody look at natasha graham who\cb1 \
\cb3 asks\cb1 \
\cb3 why would you spank a child that is not\cb1 \
\cb3 yours seems like a mental issue to me\cb1 \
\cb3 again she she pulls something straight\cb1 \
\cb3 out of the black woman's playbook\cb1 \
\cb3 shame insults guilt the need to be right\cb1 \
\cb3 the insult the guilt\cb1 \
\cb3 see if you want to exert control\cb1 \
\cb3 in your household as a step parent\cb1 \
\cb3 women like natasha want there's\cb1 \
\cb3 something\cb1 \
\cb3 mentally to be wrong with you so natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 can go out and make a child with\cb1 \
\cb3 somebody else\cb1 \
\cb3 and bring him into your household as\cb1 \
\cb3 your wife and your stepchild\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you want to discipline your child\cb1 \
\cb3 her child your your step child as you\cb1 \
\cb3 would discipline any other child\cb1 \
\cb3 you have to have a mental issue this is\cb1 \
\cb3 what\cb1 \
\cb3 is too this happens far too often\cb1 \
\cb3 with women in our community\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am seek help you sound\cb1 \
\cb3 zip damn crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 anything is men aren't taking this\cb1 \
\cb3 anymore you're gonna have to come up\cb1 \
\cb3 with a new playbook\cb1 \
\cb3 this color purpling waiting to exhale\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] this\cb1 \
\cb3 this not the same stuff is not working\cb1 \
\cb3 anymore\cb1 \
\cb3 your tactics or tricks are old and\cb1 \
\cb3 played out\cb1 \
\cb3 do better just say\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know what the hell i'm talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about and i don't understand what's\cb1 \
\cb3 going on\cb1 \
\cb3 other than trying to infer that you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what's going on you sound like you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a mental issue\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you here matter of fact she uh\cb1 \
\cb3 when she comes back off timeout\cb1 \
\cb3 moderators all right everybody lock and\cb1 \
\cb3 load on her\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody lock and load on her she says\cb1 \
\cb3 one more thing\cb1 \
\cb3 out of line time her out\cb1 \
\cb3 because i've seen her name pop up in\cb1 \
\cb3 here before and i'm tired of you\cb1 \
\cb3 women who don't seem to like to play\cb1 \
\cb3 don't you want to hate watching me hate\cb1 \
\cb3 watch\cb1 \
\cb3 don't talk family see oh i couldn't do\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 well well then guess what\cb1 \
\cb3 buy a dog and wait till they're out of\cb1 \
\cb3 the house man because\cb1 \
\cb3 is he involved in the children's life at\cb1 \
\cb3 all yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 then if you really are serious give\cb1 \
\cb3 custody to the father\cb1 \
\cb3 go off with your go off with your new\cb1 \
\cb3 husband and make a new family\cb1 \
\cb3 see oh i couldn't do that well well\cb1 \
\cb3 again what's wrong with that\cb1 \
\cb3 if you really the\cb1 \
\cb3 women you want to you want to make\cb1 \
\cb3 children with another man\cb1 \
\cb3 fine then if you get married\cb1 \
\cb3 send the children with the father and\cb1 \
\cb3 you make a new family\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i couldn't do that so you want it all\cb1 \
\cb3 and you've been told you can have it all\cb1 \
\cb3 and you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 because that man would have influence in\cb1 \
\cb3 your new husband's\cb1 \
\cb3 house that won't work and because women\cb1 \
\cb3 like natasha\cb1 \
\cb3 why'd you want to put your hands because\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot have children\cb1 \
\cb3 that you are responsible for that you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 again you sound zip damn crazy\cb1 \
\cb3 and guess what buy a dog\cb1 \
\cb3 and wait till they're out of the house\cb1 \
\cb3 man because i've talked about women like\cb1 \
\cb3 you all the time\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not willing to give anything up i\cb1 \
\cb3 asked you about discipline they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 need this they don't need that\cb1 \
\cb3 give up custody i don't can't do that\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 fit i mean no disrespect ma'am but\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not really fit\cb1 \
\cb3 to be with somebody you want someone to\cb1 \
\cb3 fit into your\cb1 \
\cb3 particular jagged life and why would\cb1 \
\cb3 a man who has options choose that\cb1 \
\cb3 just because you're attractive and yes\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe we need to start telling more\cb1 \
\cb3 women that you are not\cb1 \
\cb3 fit to be with somebody because we don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have\cb1 \
\cb3 any problems telling men you ain't ready\cb1 \
\cb3 saying you're not fit is another way of\cb1 \
\cb3 saying you're not ready your money ain't\cb1 \
\cb3 ready your mindset ain't ready you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to be a provider protect you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 want to pay\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not fit you cannot take we tell\cb1 \
\cb3 men that all the time\cb1 \
\cb3 what do we think that telling women\cb1 \
\cb3 that they're fit just because they're\cb1 \
\cb3 female\cb1 \
\cb3 because they want to get married uh show\cb1 \
\cb3 me show me that they're fit\cb1 \
\cb3 show me that the women who say they want\cb1 \
\cb3 something are fit for it\cb1 \
\cb3 because we have no problem evaluating\cb1 \
\cb3 and ranking men and it's time to start\cb1 \
\cb3 telling women the same thing\cb1 \
\cb3 because the results are showing what the\cb1 \
\cb3 truth is already telling us\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you're attractive but but in la\cb1 \
\cb3 that's a dime a dozen\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you you have to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 though\cb1 \
\cb3 i no i do know that but i think i'm more\cb1 \
\cb3 simple than just the way i look\cb1 \
\cb3 what i've said i'm i'm definitely more\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable than\cb1 \
\cb3 just my lips granted granted i'm never\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing that you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm from the midwest i'm a good\cb1 \
\cb3 midwestern girl i'm not a\cb1 \
\cb3 girl she's from the midwest\cb1 \
\cb3 she's a good midwestern girl that's what\cb1 \
\cb3 she\cb1 \
\cb3 remember this oh you cannot make this\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 let's do that again\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 but in la that's a dime a dozen\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean you you have to understand that\cb1 \
\cb3 though\cb1 \
\cb3 i no i do know that but i think i'm more\cb1 \
\cb3 people than just the way i look\cb1 \
\cb3 what i said i'm i'm definitely more\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable than\cb1 \
\cb3 just my lips granted granted i'm never\cb1 \
\cb3 seeing that you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 like i'm from the midwest i'm a good\cb1 \
\cb3 midwestern girl i'm not a\cb1 \
\cb3 girl she's more valuable than look she's\cb1 \
\cb3 for the midwest she's a good midwestern\cb1 \
\cb3 girl\cb1 \
\cb3 she's not like one of these la women\cb1 \
\cb3 remember that\cb1 \

\cb3 like pure connection like do i\cb1 \
\cb3 notice how i asked her what he would\cb1 \
\cb3 want and she is so\cb1 \
\cb3 self-absorbed that she couldn't even\cb1 \
\cb3 put herself in the position to ask what\cb1 \
\cb3 he would want\cb1 \
\cb3 she said what would he want well at the\cb1 \
\cb3 end of the day he would want what i want\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty privileged self-absorbed entitled\cb1 \
\cb3 think the world is about them oh you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot make this [ __ ] up\cb1 \

\cb3 honestly said\cb1 \
\cb3 that a man who's had to get out here and\cb1 \
\cb3 make something of himself\cb1 \
\cb3 automatically would have the only thing\cb1 \
\cb3 he would want is what the french toast\cb1 \
\cb3 she wants\cb1 \

\cb3 young lady the other day uh you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 be with somebody for a lifetime the most\cb1 \
\cb3 important decision\cb1 \
\cb3 and y'all are just down with it you just\cb1 \

\cb3 wife like maybe just a good\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife a woman that cooks for her\cb1 \
\cb3 okay ma'am so let me ask you\cb1 \
\cb3 so i want you to understand how much\cb1 \
\cb3 these i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 put what kind of thought they put in i\cb1 \
\cb3 just asked what would he want\cb1 \
\cb3 and she and you know the answer was i\cb1 \
\cb3 have no idea all i know is what the\cb1 \
\cb3 french toast i want that's how absorbed\cb1 \
\cb3 i am\cb1 \
\cb3 i want you to take care of me and my\cb1 \
\cb3 kids because i'm pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 and pretty has got me this far in life\cb1 \
\cb3 and this should keep on getting me\cb1 \
\cb3 through\cb1 \
\cb3 she still thinks she's the ish has not\cb1 \
\cb3 sat down and learned anything\cb1 \
\cb3 two kids and and uh situation children\cb1 \
\cb3 don't tend to teach\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty baby mamas nothing because they\cb1 \
\cb3 still get\cb1 \
\cb3 people trying to take them out to dinner\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to flute them out trying\cb1 \
\cb3 everything else\cb1 \
\cb3 but they're not getting wived they're\cb1 \
\cb3 not getting wife by men of value\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable men productive competitive\cb1 \
\cb3 successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 all you are is a fun girl but just\cb1 \
\cb3 because somebody will still deal with\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 hit it you still have not again\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot make this [ __ ] up oh we're\cb1 \
\cb3 almost there give me another five\cb1 \
\cb3 minutes\cb1 \
\cb3 question were your mother and father\cb1 \
\cb3 married\cb1 \
\cb3 no all right then it's\cb1 \
\cb3 then you were not raised to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife no i don't think i\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely was not raised to you know\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 so he would want a housewife but she\cb1 \
\cb3 laughs and said i definitely was not\cb1 \
\cb3 raised to be no housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's smart though i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 my dad seems to go off\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what she said he would want right\cb1 \
\cb3 and she wasn't raised to be that thing\cb1 \
\cb3 so i guess you could just decide to do\cb1 \
\cb3 that just\cb1 \
\cb3 huh that's for sure but listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen i'm hoping that dream i\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot give up on that hope and that\cb1 \
\cb3 dream again it's a hope and dream for\cb1 \
\cb3 who\cb1 \
\cb3 you sound like a nightmare for another\cb1 \
\cb3 man sounds like a nightmare\cb1 \
\cb3 for your possible husband cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 discipline\cb1 \
\cb3 his step you ain't gonna discipline the\cb1 \
\cb3 stepchildren\cb1 \
\cb3 woman that wasn't raised to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously put little thought into a man\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman who's stringing a man on for two\cb1 \
\cb3 years\cb1 \
\cb3 let's not forget about the dude she's\cb1 \
\cb3 stringing on for two years and allowing\cb1 \
\cb3 him to take her ring shop and let's not\cb1 \
\cb3 forget that\cb1 \
\cb3 there's a man out there that she's been\cb1 \
\cb3 saying she's been seriously dealing with\cb1 \
\cb3 for two years\cb1 \
\cb3 and they went ring shopping three months\cb1 \
\cb3 ago that means she went with him\cb1 \
\cb3 but yet on this podcast he's saying i\cb1 \
\cb3 just you know i'm just not uh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah yeah guys do not be afraid to ask\cb1 \
\cb3 these women anything especially don't be\cb1 \
\cb3 bad that's why you don't treat pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 women any differently\cb1 \
\cb3 far to me you guys look at a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty and you start ascribing behaviors\cb1 \
\cb3 to her no no you better treat her like\cb1 \
\cb3 big burly shirley\cb1 \
\cb3 and ask the questions that need to be\cb1 \
\cb3 asked because pretty privileged\cb1 \
\cb3 especially pretty baby mamas will get\cb1 \
\cb3 you done in\cb1 \
\cb3 because honestly far too many of them\cb1 \
\cb3 still walk through life thinking they\cb1 \
\cb3 are the [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 if you i'ma slap the smack out of you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll let you go man but you cannot over\cb1 \
\cb3 talk me\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm trying to be nice man but you're not\cb1 \
\cb3 gonna do that\cb1 \
\cb3 look you weren't raised to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 and you just said the kind of man that\cb1 \
\cb3 you would want what he wanted as a good\cb1 \
\cb3 housewife\cb1 \
\cb3 then he wouldn't want you because you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not one\cb1 \
\cb3 by your own admission you're not one\cb1 \
\cb3 i wasn't raised to be one which means\cb1 \
\cb3 you're not one\cb1 \
\cb3 but i had great influences if you had\cb1 \
\cb3 such great influences\cb1 \
\cb3 one on one\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 what you just witnessed was pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 privilege\cb1 \
\cb3 she's used to getting by on her above\cb1 \
\cb3 average looks\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's got below average outcomes and\cb1 \
\cb3 no matter how i try to talk to her\cb1 \
\cb3 she's going to sit there and stamp her\cb1 \
\cb3 feet because\cb1 \
\cb3 she was going to get her way i'm not\cb1 \
\cb3 trying\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not hard\cb1 \
\cb3 not out to foster media for the great\cb1 \
\cb3 thing at the end all right why is all\cb1 \
\cb3 this make a point\cb1 \
\cb3 why is all this making the point well\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm glad you asked\cb1 \
\cb3 glad you asked because i never do\cb1 \
\cb3 anything\cb1 \
\cb3 or without without uh\cb1 \
\cb3 without a reason this happens\cb1 \
\cb3 far too often with women who are pretty\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty baby mamas entitled self-absorbed\cb1 \
\cb3 deluded thinking that they can still go\cb1 \
\cb3 out into the world\cb1 \
\cb3 and act as if they are still the hot\cb1 \
\cb3 little thing they were with noah\cb1 \
\cb3 would just be just because they have\cb1 \
\cb3 gotten a gym lost the weight\cb1 \
\cb3 they look in the mirror and they see\cb1 \
\cb3 themselves the way they used to be but\cb1 \
\cb3 the world\cb1 \
\cb3 sees that you have one two people come\cb1 \
\cb3 out of your body\cb1 \
\cb3 and all of those experiences that came\cb1 \
\cb3 along with it those are\cb1 \
\cb3 those are city miles those aren't\cb1 \
\cb3 highway miles\cb1 \
\cb3 all right so i'm about to open the call\cb1 \
\cb3 line but you know what this story has an\cb1 \
\cb3 interesting ending\cb1 \
\cb3 in the comment section and when that\cb1 \
\cb3 show happened i actually pulled that\cb1 \
\cb3 interview out\cb1 \
\cb3 and i posted those a video and it's got\cb1 \
\cb3 over 150 000 views\cb1 \
\cb3 lots of comments and many people\cb1 \
\cb3 you know there have been several people\cb1 \
\cb3 who've talked about the video\cb1 \
\cb3 but some of the women some of the people\cb1 \
\cb3 have made comments you were too mean you\cb1 \
\cb3 were this your dad\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't give her a chance you i think\cb1 \
\cb3 you misread her\cb1 \
\cb3 and and that's and i'm like i just went\cb1 \
\cb3 off what she said but\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a firm believer and let someone talk\cb1 \
\cb3 long enough and they will tell you who\cb1 \
\cb3 they are\cb1 \
\cb3 let's see so like i said\cb1 \
\cb3 when i go into a new town i set all my\cb1 \
\cb3 dating apps\cb1 \
\cb3 oh looky there\cb1 \
\cb3 looky there guess who popped up in my\cb1 \
\cb3 dating app\cb1 \
\cb3 yup that's right\cb1 \
\cb3 so i liked the picture and i said what a\cb1 \
\cb3 small world we have\cb1 \
\cb3 indeed\cb1 \
\cb3 and her response was hmm that it is\cb1 \
\cb3 oh\cb1 \
\cb3 next question where are the kids i sold\cb1 \
\cb3 them\cb1 \
\cb3 now response was what would you like for\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 because she initiated a chat i liked the\cb1 \
\cb3 picture\cb1 \
\cb3 said it was a small world we have indeed\cb1 \
\cb3 part of me was not\cb1 \
\cb3 quite sure that was her i looked at her\cb1 \
\cb3 i was like maybe that's her maybe it's\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'll just i'll just see what's going\cb1 \
\cb3 on\cb1 \
\cb3 um dear i can't make this [ __ ] up i\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make it up make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 i cannot make this up what would you\cb1 \
\cb3 like for me\cb1 \
\cb3 i have no agenda to be honest wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 very familiar with you before i went\cb1 \
\cb3 live\cb1 \
\cb3 cool\cb1 \
\cb3 hmm i definitely sat on the wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 table unprepared fine\cb1 \
\cb3 again i'm a reasonable person\cb1 \
\cb3 try to make reasonable inferences i\cb1 \
\cb3 thought it was a i was doing my best\cb1 \
\cb3 to try to inform a caller of what she\cb1 \
\cb3 was asking\cb1 \
\cb3 and give her the best advice possible\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm always curious\cb1 \
\cb3 as to once you have a chance to look at\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 once you have a chance to sit back and\cb1 \
\cb3 see how the interaction played between\cb1 \
\cb3 both of us\cb1 \
\cb3 how you how other people perceived it\cb1 \
\cb3 you know i go back and look at some of\cb1 \
\cb3 my work and say you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i was wrong on that maybe i was\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i was wrong maybe i could have did\cb1 \
\cb3 this better\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm hard on myself because i'm always\cb1 \
\cb3 like you know what\cb1 \
\cb3 i want to be if someone calls me i want\cb1 \
\cb3 to be able to give them the best\cb1 \
\cb3 most accurate thing that i can tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm a perfectionist that way and\cb1 \
\cb3 oftentimes i run into people who i've\cb1 \
\cb3 talked to before\cb1 \
\cb3 um actually people i've actually had\cb1 \
\cb3 hard interactions with have become\cb1 \
\cb3 actually i wouldn't call them friends\cb1 \
\cb3 but you know colleagues and associates\cb1 \
\cb3 all right and the thing is you should be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to have a conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 as you move on and not have a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 if you're dealing with somebody who's\cb1 \
\cb3 balanced\cb1 \
\cb3 big curiosity all right what's your\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what did i get i make the next point\cb1 \
\cb3 here we go definitely sat on the wrong\cb1 \
\cb3 end of the table\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm prepared all right next\cb1 \
\cb3 what is your agenda in sending me a like\cb1 \
\cb3 oh there's no way to say hello\cb1 \
\cb3 so a like is all you have on these apps\cb1 \
\cb3 now remember when i said\cb1 \
\cb3 earlier pay attention\cb1 \
\cb3 i just said one word guess\cb1 \
\cb3 why did i say guess because i wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 see\cb1 \
\cb3 if what i said was on point\cb1 \
\cb3 did i was i too harsh did i\cb1 \
\cb3 did i misread the situation\cb1 \
\cb3 and the response is you'll see it right\cb1 \
\cb3 here guess\cb1 \
\cb3 guess you must do this often\cb1 \
\cb3 you couldn't possibly think i let you\cb1 \
\cb3 blow my back out\cb1 \
\cb3 gross\cb1 \
\cb3 you're 51. the only thing i let you do\cb1 \
\cb3 is take me shopping and feed me\cb1 \
\cb3 and maybe eat my pedesta if you beg\cb1 \
\cb3 so remember the i'm a good person\cb1 \
\cb3 good middle midwestern girl all this\cb1 \
\cb3 other kind of stuff\cb1 \
\cb3 now um i don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 where you kind of you can't make this\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ] up people\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the response\cb1 \
\cb3 that's the response\cb1 \
\cb3 and my response is well just just like\cb1 \
\cb3 our conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 you still proved you're sadly deluded\cb1 \
\cb3 self-absorbed\cb1 \
\cb3 and entitled everything i said about you\cb1 \
\cb3 was spot on and i really hope\cb1 \
\cb3 you seek the help you need as i said\cb1 \
\cb3 your issue as i said men are not your\cb1 \
\cb3 issue\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 dear heart\cb1 \
\cb3 you need to check yourself and women\cb1 \
\cb3 like you really need\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty privilege when it meets baby mama\cb1 \
\cb3 ism\cb1 \
\cb3 the world is difficult enough without\cb1 \
\cb3 you walking around thinking that\cb1 \
\cb3 everyone\cb1 \
\cb3 wants you\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make this [ __ ] up oh i forgot\cb1 \
\cb3 one thing too let me go ahead and put\cb1 \
\cb3 this down there\cb1 \
\cb3 uh 30 year old 5'6 and she classifies\cb1 \
\cb3 herself as a thug\cb1 \
\cb3 what is it you're spiritual\cb1 \
\cb3 and you like thugs or you classify\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself as a thug\cb1 \
\cb3 so there you go\cb1 \
\cb3 i come to la and just like when i went\cb1 \
\cb3 to new york\cb1 \
\cb3 or anywhere anywhere where i go when i\cb1 \
\cb3 moved when you came to atlanta\cb1 \
\cb3 you followed me for the longest you know\cb1 \
\cb3 that i set my apps and i do the same\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 but you honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 can take a lesson from what i just\cb1 \
\cb3 showed you when someone shows you who\cb1 \
\cb3 they are believe them the first time\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem is not men especially for\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of you pretty above average\cb1 \
\cb3 looking\cb1 \
\cb3 single baby mamas your issues with men\cb1 \
\cb3 you heap them on everybody else and\cb1 \
\cb3 assume that they are the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 no man we're not\cb1 \
\cb3 you are and women like you are\cb1 \
\cb3 so this was a long broadcast\cb1 \
\cb3 but you just can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 now if a person was as good and\cb1 \
\cb3 wholesome as you say you are\cb1 \
\cb3 hey what's a good back and forth i\cb1 \
\cb3 didn't like what you said\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but to think that i mean you're\cb1 \
\cb3 honestly\cb1 \
\cb3 um you can't make it up you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 ah she completely me\cb1 \
\cb3 so she's saying yeah yeah oh yeah that's\cb1 \
\cb3 what she said\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what she said she said what is\cb1 \
\cb3 your agenda agenda\cb1 \
\cb3 i didn't even i wasn't even quite sure\cb1 \
\cb3 that was you\cb1 \
\cb3 really saying hey how you doing how you\cb1 \
\cb3 you want to see it again\cb1 \
\cb3 what's your agenda uh just let's make it\cb1 \
\cb3 up again\cb1 \
\cb3 small world um that it is\cb1 \
\cb3 where the kids i sold them\cb1 \
\cb3 because the kids were part of the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 what would you like for me i have no\cb1 \
\cb3 agenda to be honest i was very\cb1 \
\cb3 unfamiliar with you\cb1 \
\cb3 before you went live now\cb1 \
\cb3 but ladies definitely at the wrong end\cb1 \
\cb3 of the table unprepared\cb1 \
\cb3 that's fair\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies when a man every time a man\cb1 \
\cb3 reaches out to you\cb1 \
\cb3 just because you've had bad experiences\cb1 \
\cb3 other men\cb1 \
\cb3 stop assuming that everybody wants you\cb1 \
\cb3 um i want to move it away from her\cb1 \
\cb3 because i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 make this personal about her at this\cb1 \
\cb3 point but\cb1 \
\cb3 sadly a lot of attractive women\cb1 \
\cb3 especially women who've had bad\cb1 \
\cb3 interactions with men\cb1 \
\cb3 tend not to go get the work done\cb1 \
\cb3 and you want to paint all men\cb1 \
\cb3 in a in the box of being bad\cb1 \
\cb3 when you really need to handle the\cb1 \
\cb3 issues that are going on in your own\cb1 \
\cb3 head\cb1 \
\cb3 because all i said was guess to this\cb1 \
\cb3 woman\cb1 \
\cb3 and then she and she showed what she\cb1 \
\cb3 thought of men\cb1 \
\cb3 and men in general again go back to the\cb1 \
\cb3 beginning of the show\cb1 \
\cb3 the problem is all these men who just\cb1 \
\cb3 want a pretty woman on her arm and\cb1 \
\cb3 that's it\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make it up so it didn't matter\cb1 \
\cb3 that i sat there and talked to you\cb1 \
\cb3 tried to give you good advice give you\cb1 \
\cb3 good information\cb1 \
\cb3 all men ain't crap and ultimately guys\cb1 \
\cb3 avoid women like this don't fall\cb1 \
\cb3 for the pretty when it's attached to\cb1 \
\cb3 damage\cb1 \
\cb3 don't be afraid to ask questions that\cb1 \
\cb3 you know need to be answered\cb1 \
\cb3 again you can't make this [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 for for the record\cb1 \
\cb3 now if i wanted to that's why i cut your\cb1 \
\cb3 pictures back and everything else\cb1 \
\cb3 you must do this often do what say hello\cb1 \
\cb3 to somebody on a dating app\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean ladies did i ask her anything\cb1 \
\cb3 other than\cb1 \
\cb3 hi\cb1 \
\cb3 you couldn't possibly let me thank you i\cb1 \
\cb3 let you blow my back out\cb1 \
\cb3 i really don't want to be insulting but\cb1 \
\cb3 you're attractive\cb1 \
\cb3 but dear it's la\cb1 \

\cb3 again you can't make this stuff up you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make this stuff up\cb1 \
\cb3 wow you can't make that up\cb1 \
\cb3 you just can't make that up\cb1 \
\cb3 part of the problem in modern\cb1 \
\cb3 relationships\cb1 \
\cb3 is we have unbalance we have all we have\cb1 \
\cb3 men out here\cb1 \
\cb3 being told to increase and improve get\cb1 \
\cb3 better\cb1 \
\cb3 protect provide all these things and\cb1 \
\cb3 we're not telling women that they need\cb1 \
\cb3 to do anything other than exist\cb1 \
\cb3 matter of fact we we have gotten to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point where we're telling women\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can show up in any any in any\cb1 \
\cb3 way you can show up\cb1 \
\cb3 a dress size 20 i'm a phd\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 you can show up with a man's kids\cb1 \
\cb3 and we're all supposed to just accept it\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's not working it's not working\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not working and it won't work\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 they would rather be by themselves to\cb1 \
\cb3 deal with some of this foolishness and\cb1 \
\cb3 efforty\cb1 \
\cb3 that is going on today in modern dating\cb1 \
\cb3 situations\cb1 \
\cb3 and what are you ladies prepared to do\cb1 \
\cb3 about it what are you prepared to do\cb1 \
\cb3 about\cb1 \
\cb3 other than blame men because that won't\cb1 \
\cb3 work\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot continue to blame men it's\cb1 \
\cb3 the men's fault\cb1 \
\cb3 oh yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 so here's how this is going to work\cb1 \
\cb3 here's how this is going to work you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to have to make sure you have your\cb1 \
\cb3 microphone on\cb1 \
\cb3 youtube off in the background\cb1 \
\cb3 and talking to me\cb1 \
\cb3 oh napa auto parts what's going on\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm well\cb1 \
\cb3 well considering how i've listened to\cb1 \
\cb3 how you and your colleagues have\cb1 \
\cb3 discussed\cb1 \
\cb3 me i think that's pretty fair i've never\cb1 \
\cb3 been disrespectful but how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 well i'm good i don't know well i said\cb1 \
\cb3 you and your colleagues\cb1 \
\cb3 misrepresent you i personally listen to\cb1 \
\cb3 you misrepresent what i've said\cb1 \
\cb3 so anywho i apologize i apologize if i\cb1 \
\cb3 misrepresented you i just you know most\cb1 \
\cb3 of the time i just had\cb1 \
\cb3 questions about you know the value\cb1 \
\cb3 the high value man and i i really got\cb1 \
\cb3 those questions answered i got them\cb1 \
\cb3 answered\cb1 \
\cb3 um you know i had i did a sit down with\cb1 \
\cb3 obsidian\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah but due respect obsidian is not me\cb1 \
\cb3 and i watched no no but my point is\cb1 \
\cb3 okay um i would not go i would not go\cb1 \
\cb3 um to someone who's pioneered a concept\cb1 \
\cb3 and asked someone who's just familiar\cb1 \
\cb3 with it obsidian has a point of view but\cb1 \
\cb3 he's a friend\cb1 \
\cb3 but he wanted to speak to me i've also\cb1 \
\cb3 given you an opportunity to speak to me\cb1 \
\cb3 i just\cb1 \
\cb3 i i put it this way um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to have a conversation you\cb1 \
\cb3 have it uh\cb1 \
\cb3 with good faith and the way that i've\cb1 \
\cb3 actually witnessed the conversation\cb1 \
\cb3 being had about the man of sphere or\cb1 \
\cb3 guys in the man on sphere\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't listen to other people i've sat\cb1 \
\cb3 back and watched\cb1 \
\cb3 the interactions and i've made my own\cb1 \
\cb3 judgment and that's not what i've seen\cb1 \
\cb3 from you\cb1 \
\cb3 or anyone else on that side when asked\cb1 \
\cb3 have you ever watched my content\cb1 \
\cb3 you said no not a one you have not\cb1 \
\cb3 watched the show from end to end\cb1 \
\cb3 so i don't see the value in having a\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation if you can't even be\cb1 \
\cb3 bothered to sit down and watch\cb1 \
\cb3 a broadcast fair enough okay well\cb1 \
\cb3 thank you for um you know sharing that\cb1 \
\cb3 sentiment with sentiment with me and as\cb1 \

\cb3 reasonable person\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll be nice to you if you're nice to me\cb1 \
\cb3 so let's say devon\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hi how are you\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on i'll need you guys in the chat\cb1 \
\cb3 room you guys be respectful to uh\cb1 \
\cb3 nepal and the reason i called you napa\cb1 \
\cb3 out because i don't i really don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 how to pronounce your name\cb1 \
\cb3 so it wasn't to be insulting it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 because i don't know how to pronounce\cb1 \
\cb3 your name so\cb1 \
\cb3 be uh moderators make sure that they're\cb1 \
\cb3 respectful of her in the in the comments\cb1 \
\cb3 section please\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead what you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 dionne a quick question so\cb1 \
\cb3 i was definitely one of those women\cb1 \
\cb3 i say suffering from pretty girl\cb1 \
\cb3 privilege\cb1 \
\cb3 and luckily i have gotten myself\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been dating and\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 the most compatible man that i'm dating\cb1 \
\cb3 right now has expressed\cb1 \
\cb3 interest in marriage we've been dating\cb1 \
\cb3 about four months\cb1 \
\cb3 however um because of\cb1 \
\cb3 covet and because of his line of work he\cb1 \
\cb3 is a\cb1 \
\cb3 maybe i i would say high value man if\cb1 \
\cb3 definitely not definitely a henry\cb1 \
\cb3 but because of kovalev right now um his\cb1 \
\cb3 line of work he's an entertainer he's a\cb1 \
\cb3 lead singer\cb1 \
\cb3 and an art he is unsure when they'll be\cb1 \
\cb3 touring again so when we have these\cb1 \
\cb3 conversations he's like babe i'll marry\cb1 \
\cb3 you tomorrow\cb1 \
\cb3 but i need to make sure that i can be\cb1 \
\cb3 able to take care of you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the kids and you know it's a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 when you come with children so it's like\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm grateful that i have a you know\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man that is willing to take\cb1 \
\cb3 care of me\cb1 \
\cb3 and the children but i definitely\cb1 \
\cb3 understand his position financially\cb1 \
\cb3 where he just doesn't know what the\cb1 \
\cb3 future may hold because his line of work\cb1 \
\cb3 is centered around\cb1 \
\cb3 entertaining people you know he i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 pretty sure we will get back to the\cb1 \
\cb3 point of being able to\cb1 \
\cb3 you know go to concerts so so um\cb1 \
\cb3 so just be clear do you have a question\cb1 \
\cb3 for me or were you\cb1 \
\cb3 just um because i want to be yes\cb1 \
\cb3 what's the question you have for me so\cb1 \
\cb3 my question is\cb1 \
\cb3 should i just be patient how many\cb1 \
\cb3 children do you have\cb1 \
\cb3 i have two\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm 38. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm assuming you're already employed\cb1 \
\cb3 i am yes um i actually so so if you guys\cb1 \
\cb3 got\cb1 \
\cb3 so if you guys got married today okay\cb1 \
\cb3 and they automatically start touring and\cb1 \
\cb3 they and\cb1 \
\cb3 jobs are going great\cb1 \
\cb3 and then if god forbid he was called\cb1 \
\cb3 home to glory\cb1 \
\cb3 um you'd still be able to\cb1 \
\cb3 provide for yourself and the children\cb1 \
\cb3 just fine yes\cb1 \
\cb3 okay the reason i put it that way\cb1 \
\cb3 is his up and down is nothing that he\cb1 \
\cb3 can directly control\cb1 \
\cb3 and i'm not a big fan of waiting\cb1 \
\cb3 if you are sure and he is sure\cb1 \
\cb3 because life can change like that\cb1 \
\cb3 and we spend so much time trying to wait\cb1 \
\cb3 for things to become\cb1 \
\cb3 perfect and we and we\cb1 \
\cb3 and we miss the moments in life that are\cb1 \
\cb3 meant to be\cb1 \
\cb3 chronicled with one another so um i\cb1 \
\cb3 i i definitely get a man wanting to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 provider and be able to do it he\cb1 \
\cb3 put the money where it needs to be but\cb1 \
\cb3 as it stands right now you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 be working\cb1 \
\cb3 by you're working anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 what is he is he is he working is he\cb1 \
\cb3 doing anything\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i mean luckily he's also very um\cb1 \
\cb3 very successful real estate investor so\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what's holding\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot of the passive income okay are you\cb1 \
\cb3 guys living in the same sp in the same\cb1 \
\cb3 city\cb1 \
\cb3 yes we both live in in d.c do you have\cb1 \
\cb3 an apartment or a home\cb1 \
\cb3 i've rent an apartment okay and what\cb1 \
\cb3 about him\cb1 \
\cb3 same thing or different well no he owns\cb1 \
\cb3 his place\cb1 \
\cb3 and he owns other properties\cb1 \
\cb3 um well\cb1 \
\cb3 if he's serious i don't see the downside\cb1 \
\cb3 in proceeding\cb1 \
\cb3 right so i guess my question is it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 the proceeding but i think it was one\cb1 \
\cb3 call where you were just like\cb1 \
\cb3 you know you have to i'm not afraid of\cb1 \
\cb3 putting some parameters you know i know\cb1 \
\cb3 you say like some women are afraid to\cb1 \
\cb3 put parameters because they know the guy\cb1 \
\cb3 is going to walk you know\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm i'm i'm definitely unafraid of\cb1 \
\cb3 that i'm just wondering\cb1 \
\cb3 is it is it necessary because at this\cb1 \
\cb3 point this is probably the\cb1 \
\cb3 parameters i may get parameters meaning\cb1 \
\cb3 what\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning like we should be you know\cb1 \
\cb3 thinking about getting\cb1 \
\cb3 you know married by this day and he\cb1 \
\cb3 wants to have more children i would give\cb1 \
\cb3 him as many children as he wants\cb1 \
\cb3 but i'm 38. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 but does he does he if he wants to marry\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 and he's serious you sound like you're\cb1 \
\cb3 open to it so\cb1 \
\cb3 um let him know i don't see what the\cb1 \
\cb3 holdup is on his side if he's serious\cb1 \
\cb3 about marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 i think it's it's it's i can tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 it's purely financial he just wants to\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to make sure he can carry the\cb1 \
\cb3 you know the lifestyle i get it but\cb1 \
\cb3 again life happens um\cb1 \
\cb3 if you want to be with him make it clear\cb1 \
\cb3 to him that look i appreciate you want\cb1 \
\cb3 to be able to do that but i'd rather be\cb1 \
\cb3 with you\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm working anyway i mean i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 just not really\cb1 \
\cb3 there's too many things that are\cb1 \
\cb3 spinning right now that's why i have\cb1 \
\cb3 this little thing spinning over here you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't\cb1 \
\cb3 predict everything so um more often than\cb1 \
\cb3 not men want to know that you're going\cb1 \
\cb3 to you're going to be there through the\cb1 \
\cb3 up and the down\cb1 \
\cb3 more than anything else that's more than\cb1 \
\cb3 anything else so\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't know if you've had the\cb1 \
\cb3 conversation with him to say you know\cb1 \
\cb3 what i would i would hope you could make\cb1 \
\cb3 millions\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you if you make it enough to uh\cb1 \
\cb3 to take care of yourself i'm good with\cb1 \
\cb3 it we can eat peanut butter jelly and\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i mean i just don't see\cb1 \
\cb3 the downside\cb1 \
\cb3 get on with the living either get busy\cb1 \
\cb3 with living and get busy with dying and\cb1 \
\cb3 slaying by yourself especially if you\cb1 \
\cb3 got somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 who you're serious what he seriously do\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't really see the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem with that i appreciate you\cb1 \
\cb3 calling in man\cb1 \
\cb3 bye-bye yeah i mean\cb1 \
\cb3 we we can't have it perfect i get we\cb1 \
\cb3 want perfect but we don't get perfect\cb1 \
\cb3 we get it we get close enough all right\cb1 \
\cb3 so\cb1 \
\cb3 um ivory\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes your first name what do you got for\cb1 \
\cb3 me\cb1 \
\cb3 on how else i can grow to be more of a\cb1 \
\cb3 blessing to my future husband as a\cb1 \
\cb3 single mom\cb1 \
\cb3 okay all right to your future husband\cb1 \
\cb3 yes are you seeing anyone seriously now\cb1 \
\cb3 no\cb1 \
\cb3 how many children do you have one\cb1 \
\cb3 uh age and gender he is four\cb1 \
\cb3 where's the father he\cb1 \
\cb3 abandoned us whenever i was still\cb1 \
\cb3 pregnant he's in the picture now and we\cb1 \
\cb3 split custody around 60 40. i'm the\cb1 \
\cb3 primary\cb1 \
\cb3 okay uh is this through the court system\cb1 \
\cb3 or you guys just have a\cb1 \
\cb3 an arraignment courts yes all right so\cb1 \
\cb3 future men ultimately in order to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 is a precarious thing it really is\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 i've been there um do you\cb1 \
\cb3 well one do you ever want to have any\cb1 \
\cb3 additional children\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm impartial if i\cb1 \
\cb3 am married to somebody and he wants that\cb1 \
\cb3 i believe in submission\cb1 \
\cb3 and i will give my husband children but\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't\cb1 \
\cb3 particularly care if i have more\cb1 \
\cb3 by the way i'm 29. okay\cb1 \
\cb3 um\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding how the child gets sorted\cb1 \
\cb3 out that's really the biggest thing\cb1 \
\cb3 the biggest issue when it comes to\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with a woman with children\cb1 \
\cb3 is discipline of the child provision\cb1 \
\cb3 obviously but discipline and\cb1 \
\cb3 if you if you've never really had to\cb1 \
\cb3 co-parent with anybody\cb1 \
\cb3 your word has been law\cb1 \
\cb3 um and you know as a man who's been a\cb1 \
\cb3 stepfather\cb1 \
\cb3 that child will quickly children test\cb1 \
\cb3 and they will quickly run understand\cb1 \
\cb3 where the lines are drawn would would\cb1 \
\cb3 the man you marry\cb1 \
\cb3 be able to parent your child\cb1 \
\cb3 as if he were the biological father\cb1 \
\cb3 i would hope so and that is next\cb1 \
\cb3 question\cb1 \
\cb3 can i ask yeah go ahead go ahead my next\cb1 \
\cb3 question is\cb1 \
\cb3 at what point would it be appropriate to\cb1 \
\cb3 introduce\cb1 \
\cb3 a man into my child's life because i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 not going to just\cb1 \
\cb3 bring anybody that i'm interested in\cb1 \
\cb3 into my child's life\cb1 \
\cb3 and i've heard about setting boundaries\cb1 \
\cb3 of if you're engaged that would be the\cb1 \
\cb3 appropriate time and i am\cb1 \
\cb3 very adamant on teaching my child to be\cb1 \
\cb3 respectful\cb1 \
\cb3 and okay so in general i mean yeah you\cb1 \
\cb3 don't need to be bringing them around\cb1 \
\cb3 people you're dating\cb1 \
\cb3 uh but and you know\cb1 \
\cb3 here's the thing i think engagement is a\cb1 \
\cb3 nice milestone but it's not very\cb1 \
\cb3 realistic because there's going to be a\cb1 \
\cb3 lot to happen before that\cb1 \
\cb3 the question ultimately comes down to\cb1 \
\cb3 um where's your husband going to fit\cb1 \
\cb3 because ma'am your child comes first\cb1 \
\cb3 how do you how do you navigate putting a\cb1 \
\cb3 man first\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not sure i understand what you're\cb1 \
\cb3 asking because my\cb1 \
\cb3 meaning your child is your number one\cb1 \
\cb3 priority right now\cb1 \
\cb3 right now yes if you were to meet a man\cb1 \
\cb3 especially a man of\cb1 \
\cb3 a valuable man a man i mean he is going\cb1 \
\cb3 to have to become number one that means\cb1 \
\cb3 your child is going to have to become\cb1 \
\cb3 number two\cb1 \
\cb3 within the marriage i believe so no no\cb1 \
\cb3 see that's the problem that's a problem\cb1 \
\cb3 you a man would have to marry you and\cb1 \
\cb3 and hope\cb1 \
\cb3 that that would happen and that's\cb1 \
\cb3 unrealistic\cb1 \
\cb3 see you're going to have to resolve how\cb1 \
\cb3 to make this is why it's so difficult\cb1 \
\cb3 uh dating and seriously data is a single\cb1 \
\cb3 mother\cb1 \
\cb3 you your child is your number one\cb1 \
\cb3 priority as it should be\cb1 \
\cb3 but the way the world is supposed to be\cb1 \
\cb3 set up you're supposed to be married to\cb1 \
\cb3 the father your child so you don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 to deal with these things\cb1 \
\cb3 yes what you're ultimately asking a man\cb1 \
\cb3 to do is marry me\cb1 \
\cb3 then trust me that i will do what it is\cb1 \
\cb3 you say because i say i'm submissive and\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 that's just the bet that no smart man\cb1 \
\cb3 should take\cb1 \
\cb3 not today we have too many cases of\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 flipping the script on men and it's just\cb1 \
\cb3 unreasonable this is why i often tell\cb1 \
\cb3 women if you're serious\cb1 \
\cb3 uh give custody do you have a son or a\cb1 \
\cb3 daughter\cb1 \
\cb3 a son at seven years old he should be\cb1 \
\cb3 with his daddy anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 he said that's more that's why i said\cb1 \
\cb3 give custody to give custody to the\cb1 \
\cb3 father\cb1 \
\cb3 are you serious about even if your\cb1 \
\cb3 father is not masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't see again i can't nope you\cb1 \
\cb3 picked him\cb1 \
\cb3 you picked him and i got 60 40 anyway\cb1 \
\cb3 see what i'm hearing ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 is control issues which which is fair\cb1 \
\cb3 but you've never had to negotiate\cb1 \
\cb3 do anything with anybody else the word\cb1 \
\cb3 you are the queen and the word stops\cb1 \
\cb3 with you\cb1 \
\cb3 this is why single mothers are for fun\cb1 \
\cb3 and not for long term\cb1 \
\cb3 because let's say you were dating a man\cb1 \
\cb3 like myself i am not going to marry you\cb1 \
\cb3 and then\cb1 \
\cb3 let you tell me that you got to pay all\cb1 \
\cb3 the bills as if\cb1 \
\cb3 this is your biological child and then i\cb1 \
\cb3 gotta trust that you're gonna do things\cb1 \
\cb3 my way you know you gotta demonstrate\cb1 \
\cb3 that to me before i'm gonna make a\cb1 \
\cb3 lifelong commitment to you\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why i say you let you single\cb1 \
\cb3 mothers really gotta understand what\cb1 \
\cb3 you're asking for men\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what that whole video was about\cb1 \
\cb3 that woman did not understand what she's\cb1 \
\cb3 asking\cb1 \
\cb3 lastly you you're saying that you\cb1 \
\cb3 are an indifferent to children then\cb1 \
\cb3 marrying you\cb1 \
\cb3 the man possibly gets no kids and a lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of liability\cb1 \
\cb3 and a non-masculine\cb1 \
\cb3 baby daddy in the picture and a boy to\cb1 \
\cb3 raise\cb1 \
\cb3 man that's that doesn't sound very\cb1 \
\cb3 appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 i hate to break it i have to be that\cb1 \
\cb3 direct but that's just doesn't sound\cb1 \
\cb3 very appealing\cb1 \
\cb3 but all the best thank you bye\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah ladies you know understand\cb1 \
\cb3 something when you just when you choose\cb1 \
\cb3 to make a child\cb1 \
\cb3 it's a big freaking deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and we have minimized it and made it no\cb1 \
\cb3 big deal because you can\cb1 \
\cb3 make have a job and take care of your\cb1 \
\cb3 kid that's fine\cb1 \
\cb3 but interacting with a man a completely\cb1 \
\cb3 different set of circumstances\cb1 \
\cb3 um tyra tiara\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm yourself hello\cb1 \
\cb3 hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes first name\cb1 \
\cb3 what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 well before we before we do that before\cb1 \
\cb3 we do that\cb1 \
\cb3 uh how old are you\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and why should i have you come on\cb1 \
\cb3 and speak to the younger\cb1 \
\cb3 you haven't told me what you what that\cb1 \
\cb3 you why\cb1 \
\cb3 that doesn't make any sense to me you\cb1 \
\cb3 want to come in i'm preaching and you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to come in and say by the way i\cb1 \
\cb3 need to talk to the people over here\cb1 \
\cb3 how do i know you even more talking to\cb1 \
\cb3 what you want to tell them\cb1 \
\cb3 okay go ahead\cb1 \
\cb3 okay\cb1 \
\cb3 okay they always are\cb1 \
\cb3 wait a minute hold on you you you you're\cb1 \
\cb3 saying thing okay\cb1 \
\cb3 you start talking about high-value men\cb1 \
\cb3 and cautioning women\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am have you ever been married\cb1 \
\cb3 after the father of your child\cb1 \
\cb3 all right is he still in the child's\cb1 \
\cb3 life\cb1 \
\cb3 okay so hi val are you\cb1 \
\cb3 currently seeing someone seriously\cb1 \
\cb3 so why are you why are you talking about\cb1 \
\cb3 high value man\cb1 \
\cb3 why you think that is\cb1 \
\cb3 right and what are you calling a man of\cb1 \
\cb3 high value just his income\cb1 \
\cb3 no no i'm very specific about on my\cb1 \
\cb3 channel i'm very specific about what i\cb1 \
\cb3 call high value\cb1 \
\cb3 and what you ladies tend to do is you\cb1 \
\cb3 call high value things that aren't high\cb1 \
\cb3 value\cb1 \
\cb3 but a high value man is a man who makes\cb1 \
\cb3 a\cb1 \
\cb3 over six figures for at least five years\cb1 \
\cb3 in a row\cb1 \
\cb3 he's acknowledged by other high value\cb1 \
\cb3 men as being one of their peers\cb1 \
\cb3 has a network of high value men and\cb1 \
\cb3 other people\cb1 \
\cb3 has a career or a profession or\cb1 \
\cb3 something that's linkedin level\cb1 \
\cb3 people understand what it is at a glance\cb1 \
\cb3 and is useful to others and the group\cb1 \
\cb3 so that's a lot to be so if you don't\cb1 \
\cb3 have one\cb1 \
\cb3 you want a man like this and why would a\cb1 \
\cb3 man like that\cb1 \
\cb3 who has most women want men like that\cb1 \
\cb3 right why would they want a woman who's\cb1 \
\cb3 already has a child by someone else\cb1 \
\cb3 that's why it's hard to get one\cb1 \
\cb3 because they're valuable\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's unrealistic to think i'm sorry\cb1 \
\cb3 to say\cb1 \
\cb3 man to think this as a\cb1 \
\cb3 even as a divorcee with a child that\cb1 \
\cb3 you'll land one\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah don't get pregnant yeah don't get\cb1 \
\cb3 married before you carry that's right\cb1 \
\cb3 marry before you carry\cb1 \
\cb3 but the rest of your life you know if\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 hey what's the rest of your life going\cb1 \
\cb3 to look like now that you have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 and you and your husband are divorced\cb1 \
\cb3 you know\cb1 \
\cb3 the next part but i would say take high\cb1 \
\cb3 value out of the entire equation\cb1 \
\cb3 because high value is a very small\cb1 \
\cb3 segment of men\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are plenty of productive\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful men but you got\cb1 \
\cb3 to ask\cb1 \
\cb3 one question what are you bringing to\cb1 \
\cb3 the table\cb1 \
\cb3 that the kind of man that you would want\cb1 \
\cb3 what does he want\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's one thing that you ladies you\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies tend to not really answer\cb1 \
\cb3 okay thank you\cb1 \
\cb3 all right um yeah ladies you're gonna\cb1 \
\cb3 have to ask yourself a simple question\cb1 \
\cb3 um yeah they couldn't hear the audio it\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't don't worry about it\cb1 \
\cb3 um go ahead and mute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll re uh okay\cb1 \
\cb3 hold on tiara this second i mean no\cb1 \
\cb3 don't let me tear i just need you\cb1 \
\cb3 um all right\cb1 \
\cb3 so to the people said you couldn't hear\cb1 \
\cb3 basically she wanted to caution young\cb1 \
\cb3 ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 to marry before you carry\cb1 \
\cb3 um there's not a lot to that one\cb1 \
\cb3 because you know\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll i'll i'll go over later there's not\cb1 \
\cb3 a lot to that call\cb1 \
\cb3 she was just trying to give some advice\cb1 \
\cb3 that she really wasn't ready to give\cb1 \
\cb3 uh hello\cb1 \
\cb3 yes first name\cb1 \
\cb3 uh um hold on hold\cb1 \
\cb3 on hold on i'll be nice to you\cb1 \
\cb3 if you be nice to me that's all i\cb1 \
\cb3 i just you want to go by lewis okay how\cb1 \
\cb3 are you\cb1 \
\cb3 how are you i'm fine good evening\cb1 \
\cb3 that's that's that's yeah you're coming\cb1 \
\cb3 into a place let's\cb1 \
\cb3 uh what do you have for me louis\cb1 \
\cb3 well i had i have a question and then i\cb1 \
\cb3 wanted to\cb1 \
\cb3 make a statement my question is why are\cb1 \
\cb3 you giving\cb1 \
\cb3 women why are you shaming women who\cb1 \
\cb3 louis what you're not going to do\cb1 \
\cb3 is what you just attempted to do\cb1 \
\cb3 i said it first and i'll say it again\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll be nice to you if you're nice to me\cb1 \
\cb3 but uh if all you can use is shaming\cb1 \
\cb3 language and these kind of things\cb1 \
\cb3 i'll bid you a good night\cb1 \
\cb3 you either have a conversation like a\cb1 \
\cb3 reasonable adult\cb1 \
\cb3 or you go elsewhere\cb1 \
\cb3 now you cannot mute yourself and attempt\cb1 \
\cb3 to do this one more again\cb1 \
\cb3 i do not accept yeah i do not accept you\cb1 \
\cb3 coming in here saying\cb1 \
\cb3 shaming this no ma'am nope no ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 so what you what you're going to do is\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to be respectful of what\cb1 \
\cb3 look man i'm having to raise my voice i\cb1 \
\cb3 have pleasant conversations with\cb1 \
\cb3 everybody else\cb1 \
\cb3 and because you may be what in your\cb1 \
\cb3 feelings a little upset\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not shaming anything the 5 000\cb1 \
\cb3 people who watched it\cb1 \
\cb3 so what what is your issue well thank\cb1 \
\cb3 you\cb1 \
\cb3 people it makes you it makes me feel\cb1 \
\cb3 like that\cb1 \
\cb3 it's making women feel shameful that\cb1 \
\cb3 they\cb1 \
\cb3 had kids by a man and\cb1 \
\cb3 that wasn't their plan for life like\cb1 \
\cb3 that's not their life\cb1 \

\cb3 that a woman did not want to bring to\cb1 \
\cb3 this world\cb1 \
\cb3 so so to say that i'm making them feel\cb1 \
\cb3 shameful for a choice they made\cb1 \
\cb3 no you choose to be a parent that has\cb1 \
\cb3 consequences\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't think choosing to be a parent is\cb1 \
\cb3 a negative thing and\cb1 \
\cb3 i never said it was a negative thing i\cb1 \
\cb3 just said it has consequences\cb1 \
\cb3 i think where everything in life has\cb1 \
\cb3 consequences but choosing to be a parent\cb1 \
\cb3 ha okay but see what you came under\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to do is\cb1 \
\cb3 you telling women and having a child\cb1 \
\cb3 that they didn't plan or\cb1 \
\cb3 this the life didn't work it's shameful\cb1 \
\cb3 man\cb1 \
\cb3 life is no you didn't let me finish\cb1 \
\cb3 well because i was first there you're\cb1 \
\cb3 not you're not gonna talk over me\cb1 \
\cb3 when you come in here telling me that\cb1 \
\cb3 it's shameful what i'm doing\cb1 \
\cb3 you can say what you have to say you\cb1 \
\cb3 have 20 seconds\cb1 \
\cb3 but be respectful i'm not saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 what you're saying is shameful i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying it will make a woman feel\cb1 \
\cb3 shameful that you're saying that because\cb1 \
\cb3 they have a kid there's no\cb1 \
\cb3 future in that for them they they can't\cb1 \
\cb3 find it they're not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to be able to be married or get a\cb1 \
\cb3 husband\cb1 \
\cb3 no that's not what i said but i mean but\cb1 \
\cb3 let me\cb1 \
\cb3 let me make it real clear we do need to\cb1 \
\cb3 bring\cb1 \
\cb3 shame back because you ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 well because here's the thing i talk\cb1 \
\cb3 about a\cb1 \
\cb3 cal a certain caliber of man and these\cb1 \
\cb3 men don't want children\cb1 \
\cb3 from another another man ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 do you not think okay do you have any\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 yes i do you have a son uh-huh\cb1 \
\cb3 okay you so your son makes something of\cb1 \
\cb3 himself he becomes an attorney\cb1 \
\cb3 a well-regarded attorney 35 years old\cb1 \
\cb3 you want him you think that he should\cb1 \
\cb3 bring home\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman with three kids by two different\cb1 \
\cb3 dudes\cb1 \
\cb3 i think he should bring home a woman no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no see you didn't answer no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no yes no no see no no no no\cb1 \
\cb3 no i didn't get the [ __ ] question out\cb1 \
\cb3 of my mouth before you decide see\cb1 \
\cb3 you know what i'll let you go ahead you\cb1 \
\cb3 think he should do what\cb1 \
\cb3 i think he should bring home whoever he\cb1 \
\cb3 please\cb1 \
\cb3 whoever he's happy with right just\cb1 \
\cb3 because a woman doesn't have a kid\cb1 \
\cb3 doesn't mean that you're going to be\cb1 \
\cb3 happy with her\cb1 \
\cb3 ma'am where's your husband i've turned\cb1 \
\cb3 down two proposals because\cb1 \
\cb3 how many children do you have i have one\cb1 \
\cb3 child\cb1 \
\cb3 okay why are you so upset that i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 telling the reality that men want\cb1 \
\cb3 men don't want women who have children\cb1 \
\cb3 by other men\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me especially productive\cb1 \
\cb3 competitive successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 higher value men choose overwhelmingly\cb1 \
\cb3 to start their own families\cb1 \
\cb3 see what you have a problem with man is\cb1 \
\cb3 men finally saying what men have always\cb1 \
\cb3 thought\cb1 \
\cb3 if you don't want the downsides or\cb1 \
\cb3 consequences that come along with being\cb1 \
\cb3 a single mother\cb1 \
\cb3 get married before you have a baby i\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate the truth\cb1 \
\cb3 and the honesty um\cb1 \
\cb3 then what's the problem\cb1 \
\cb3 well i mean but what's the problem with\cb1 \
\cb3 saying i just don't\cb1 \
\cb3 feel like feelings man what's the\cb1 \
\cb3 problem\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah you cannot over talk to me you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot do that\cb1 \
\cb3 calm down and and just respond\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot mute yourself but you can't\cb1 \
\cb3 overtalk me\cb1 \
\cb3 see this is another reason\cb1 \
\cb3 dealing with women with children you get\cb1 \
\cb3 overly emotional because\cb1 \
\cb3 your children are important to you but\cb1 \
\cb3 they're on but they're important to you\cb1 \
\cb3 not us you cannot mute yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 wow that is not true you you can\cb1 \
\cb3 no no your children are important to\cb1 \
\cb3 you they're not important to us\cb1 \
\cb3 it's like my child is important excuse\cb1 \
\cb3 me ma'am\cb1 \
\cb3 your child is important to you it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 important to us\cb1 \
\cb3 and here's the here's the real question\cb1 \
\cb3 other men out in the the public not now\cb1 \
\cb3 excuse me man no this ain't about me man\cb1 \
\cb3 why didn't you\cb1 \
\cb3 why are you and your why didn't you\cb1 \
\cb3 marry the man you chose to have a child\cb1 \
\cb3 with\cb1 \
\cb3 he wasn't good enough for me well then\cb1 \
\cb3 that's okay so what i need you to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 on the open dating market you come into\cb1 \
\cb3 the open dating market\cb1 \
\cb3 with a baby from a man you say wasn't\cb1 \
\cb3 good enough for you\cb1 \
\cb3 to us to men like myself to men with\cb1 \
\cb3 good sense\cb1 \
\cb3 that what says she is a poor judge of\cb1 \
\cb3 character\cb1 \
\cb3 because she gave a man the highest honor\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman can give any man on the planet\cb1 \
\cb3 a child and then she gave a man who\cb1 \
\cb3 wasn't good enough for her\cb1 \
\cb3 a baby sorry ma'am don't get upset\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 that's great but if you agree with it\cb1 \
\cb3 then understand\cb1 \
\cb3 i agree there's a reason but i also want\cb1 \
\cb3 to say that i'm allowed to\cb1 \
\cb3 make poor judgments because well yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 you oh yeah you are but you you are\cb1 \
\cb3 stopped yeah you are but we don't have\cb1 \
\cb3 but understand something listen listen\cb1 \
\cb3 listen listen listen you are but the\cb1 \
\cb3 world does not owe you\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding you're allowed to make you\cb1 \
\cb3 are allowed to make they don't\cb1 \
\cb3 but guess what we are going to just does\cb1 \
\cb3 it too\cb1 \
\cb3 man we all do it you don't set your\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional self down\cb1 \
\cb3 lady i'm sorry that the world is not\cb1 \
\cb3 going to continue\cb1 \
\cb3 the world ain't going to continue to\cb1 \
\cb3 first of all your child is your least of\cb1 \
\cb3 your problems\cb1 \
\cb3 and this is the kind of [ __ ] that\cb1 \
\cb3 goes on too often with women black women\cb1 \
\cb3 in particular\cb1 \
\cb3 think you know because you can get your\cb1 \
\cb3 ass up here and be emotional and talk\cb1 \
\cb3 loud\cb1 \
\cb3 it's going to overcome the fact that you\cb1 \
\cb3 made a baby with a dude that you say\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't good enough\cb1 \
\cb3 that's your problem the world does not\cb1 \
\cb3 owe you\cb1 \
\cb3 understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 and you sound like you need a whole lot\cb1 \
\cb3 of damn therapy because you're far too\cb1 \
\cb3 angry about some [ __ ] you chose to do\cb1 \
\cb3 you can't make this [ __ ] up people\cb1 \
\cb3 angry ass i'm entitled to make mistakes\cb1 \
\cb3 no no\cb1 \
\cb3 you can make them but no one has to live\cb1 \
\cb3 with them with you that's why you buy\cb1 \
\cb3 your\cb1 \
\cb3 i've turned down proposals not by man\cb1 \
\cb3 worth anything\cb1 \
\cb3 see what it does is it youth ladies have\cb1 \
\cb3 been told\cb1 \
\cb3 that having a child is no big deal\cb1 \
\cb3 and the reality is it's a really big\cb1 \
\cb3 deal\cb1 \
\cb3 you are relegated to getting men who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't worth a damn\cb1 \
\cb3 and ain't worth [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and berlin\cb1 \
\cb3 uh yes i can\cb1 \
\cb3 no problem your first name\cb1 \
\cb3 your first name what do you got for me\cb1 \
\cb3 amber\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah so um miss louise louise whatever\cb1 \
\cb3 her name is\cb1 \
\cb3 she reminded me like she brought up a\cb1 \
\cb3 question i always wonder so women who\cb1 \
\cb3 already have children are you saying\cb1 \
\cb3 there is no potential for her to find a\cb1 \
\cb3 good man\cb1 \
\cb3 or if so like which man\cb1 \
\cb3 no i'm not no i am not saying that\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm not saying that what i am saying is\cb1 \
\cb3 women who have\cb1 \
\cb3 children need to understand that those\cb1 \
\cb3 children\cb1 \
\cb3 are a liability to us men\cb1 \
\cb3 and judging a woman like you versus\cb1 \
\cb3 another\cb1 \
\cb3 one a woman with no children you are not\cb1 \
\cb3 equal to us\cb1 \
\cb3 you're going to have to do more to\cb1 \
\cb3 compensate for the fact that you're\cb1 \
\cb3 bringing another whole human being\cb1 \
\cb3 to me to provide for and\cb1 \
\cb3 all the stuff that comes along with it\cb1 \
\cb3 let me give you an example amber how old\cb1 \
\cb3 are you\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm 24. in the in the animal\cb1 \
\cb3 communi in the animal in in the animal\cb1 \
\cb3 kingdom\cb1 \
\cb3 if a a new alpha male or a new\cb1 \
\cb3 male takes over an existing\cb1 \
\cb3 pride or an existing group of females\cb1 \
\cb3 what does he do to the children the cubs\cb1 \
\cb3 what do they do to him so what did he\cb1 \
\cb3 just take over that family\cb1 \
\cb3 is that what you're saying yeah what is\cb1 \
\cb3 the if a male\cb1 \
\cb3 if a male lion takes over a pride of\cb1 \
\cb3 female lions and they have cubs\cb1 \
\cb3 what is the male what does the new male\cb1 \
\cb3 lion do to the kid\cb1 \
\cb3 the the cubs from other male lions what\cb1 \
\cb3 does he do to those cubs\cb1 \
\cb3 the base off the topic it seems like he\cb1 \
\cb3 won't\cb1 \
\cb3 even kill a member they kill him\cb1 \
\cb3 okay see this is why we don't seem to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand it is not in a man's nature\cb1 \
\cb3 to\cb1 \
\cb3 it it goes against our biological\cb1 \
\cb3 imperative to\cb1 \
\cb3 to protect provide for other men's kids\cb1 \
\cb3 all throughout the animal kingdom men\cb1 \
\cb3 kill children from other men\cb1 \
\cb3 and guess what the lionesses do sit\cb1 \
\cb3 their ass there and take it\cb1 \
\cb3 and then make new kids with the new lion\cb1 \
\cb3 this is something that we used to\cb1 \
\cb3 understand\cb1 \
\cb3 but in the last 50 years we've told\cb1 \
\cb3 women\cb1 \
\cb3 don't matter girl you got a job you can\cb1 \
\cb3 provide\cb1 \
\cb3 you can take care of but you cannot you\cb1 \
\cb3 cannot\cb1 \
\cb3 be everything to a child you need two\cb1 \
\cb3 parents\cb1 \
\cb3 to be balanced and if you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 child it's not a death sentence but you\cb1 \
\cb3 better understand something\cb1 \
\cb3 it is going to be far more difficult to\cb1 \
\cb3 date a man especially the higher up you\cb1 \
\cb3 go\cb1 \
\cb3 the more you want that man to be\cb1 \
\cb3 productive competitive successful the\cb1 \
\cb3 higher value\cb1 \
\cb3 the better man he is the more you're\cb1 \
\cb3 going to have to compensate because\cb1 \
\cb3 the competition is stiff you're\cb1 \
\cb3 competing with the women around him\cb1 \
\cb3 does that make sense okay so it does\cb1 \
\cb3 so if a woman already have children so\cb1 \
\cb3 what type of\cb1 \
\cb3 men what is her only option like what i\cb1 \
\cb3 can't demand\cb1 \
\cb3 there is nothing that's a hundred\cb1 \
\cb3 percent but here's the thing\cb1 \
\cb3 you have a child i do not\cb1 \
\cb3 all right why is this important to you\cb1 \
\cb3 because i just felt like she was very\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional and i can understand\cb1 \
\cb3 what why she was but why was she\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional\cb1 \
\cb3 she was emotional because she's\cb1 \
\cb3 emotional because she knows\cb1 \
\cb3 whether she can communicate it or not\cb1 \
\cb3 that life is harder\cb1 \
\cb3 as a single mother trying to date\cb1 \
\cb3 especially the higher up man you go\cb1 \
\cb3 because that's just the world\cb1 \
\cb3 she's emotional because she's angry\cb1 \
\cb3 she's angry at the reality of the world\cb1 \
\cb3 and it's not the world's problem she\cb1 \
\cb3 lives in the world that i live in\cb1 \
\cb3 see you're only angry when you're trying\cb1 \
\cb3 to get an outcome\cb1 \
\cb3 that you can't get and you the game is\cb1 \
\cb3 rigged it's not fair\cb1 \
\cb3 no you're supposed to be married to the\cb1 \
\cb3 man who you make children with\cb1 \
\cb3 that's what's supposed to happen if you\cb1 \
\cb3 choose not to do that you deal with all\cb1 \
\cb3 the outcomes did you hear that she said\cb1 \
\cb3 i made a baby with a man who wasn't good\cb1 \
\cb3 enough\cb1 \
\cb3 yes who the [ __ ] wants to be with a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman who had a baby with a man who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't good enough\cb1 \
\cb3 i agree but um i just felt like she just\cb1 \
\cb3 felt like\cb1 \
\cb3 from some reason she felt like she\cb1 \
\cb3 should be ashamed for having a child by\cb1 \
\cb3 someone she's not\cb1 \
\cb3 well well yeah you should you should\cb1 \
\cb3 my personal opinion you should because\cb1 \
\cb3 you didn't have to\cb1 \
\cb3 we need to get to the point where we\cb1 \
\cb3 need to we we have taken shame\cb1 \
\cb3 and guilt away from the black community\cb1 \
\cb3 and look at what has gotten us\cb1 \
\cb3 this is what you have when you have a\cb1 \
\cb3 woman say i had a baby by a man who\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't good enough\cb1 \
\cb3 what we supposed to just give a lollipop\cb1 \
\cb3 and say no problem\cb1 \
\cb3 go over there and get one of those\cb1 \
\cb3 productive competitive successful men\cb1 \
\cb3 and get him to raise the ain't [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 man's kid\cb1 \
\cb3 go put that on your brother would you\cb1 \
\cb3 want your brother to be with her\cb1 \
\cb3 and ray would you want that to be your\cb1 \
\cb3 would you want that to be your step\cb1 \
\cb3 uh nephew\cb1 \
\cb3 see i can't say because i just felt like\cb1 \
\cb3 things happened first of all black women\cb1 \
\cb3 need to stop with this future take\cb1 \
\cb3 feeling out of it\cb1 \
\cb3 it ain't about your feelings it's about\cb1 \
\cb3 practical choices\cb1 \
\cb3 would do you have a brother i do\cb1 \
\cb3 would you do you love your brother i do\cb1 \
\cb3 then why would you want your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 taking on the responsibility of a woman\cb1 \
\cb3 who had a child with a man she says\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't [ __ ] and the offspring\cb1 \
\cb3 you must not love him that much if you\cb1 \
\cb3 want him to say yeah bro go take that\cb1 \
\cb3 versus going to have a woman who has no\cb1 \
\cb3 kids and make your own\cb1 \
\cb3 see he he actually has been in that\cb1 \
\cb3 situation before\cb1 \
\cb3 and it was not like a child\cb1 \
\cb3 and where's your dad where's your dad\cb1 \
\cb3 he's with my mother\cb1 \
\cb3 they've been together ever since so your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother your brother and hell is your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 um he's 34. so you're telling me your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 decided to get with a woman who had a\cb1 \
\cb3 child by duty she said ain't [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 i mean i'm not necessarily don't know\cb1 \
\cb3 and she said he's not [ __ ] but the\cb1 \
\cb3 man was not in the child's life so\cb1 \
\cb3 ultimate question\cb1 \
\cb3 is is that the best choice for your\cb1 \
\cb3 brother\cb1 \
\cb3 if he feels like the woman is best for\cb1 \
\cb3 him\cb1 \
\cb3 and again this is what we get then this\cb1 \
\cb3 is and this is the loop that comes with\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 we keep going back to these feelings and\cb1 \
\cb3 what it comes down to is such a lack of\cb1 \
\cb3 respect for men\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm sorry man no other race of women\cb1 \
\cb3 would sit around and say yeah\cb1 \
\cb3 go ahead and strap on the responsibility\cb1 \
\cb3 and feedback of another man's child\cb1 \
\cb3 and take that on brother other women\cb1 \
\cb3 have more respect for their men than\cb1 \
\cb3 black women\cb1 \
\cb3 i'm gonna leave this in because you\cb1 \
\cb3 can't make this [ __ ] up\cb1 \
\cb3 you cannot make this up\cb1 \
\cb3 okay and kevin i guess like the reason\cb1 \
\cb3 why\cb1 \
\cb3 i was trying to relate in a way is\cb1 \
\cb3 because\cb1 \
\cb3 it's hard when i see my brother and my\cb1 \
\cb3 sister in the same situation\cb1 \
\cb3 but i myself always brother your brother\cb1 \
\cb3 and your sister\cb1 \
\cb3 you're about i don't understand you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a sister yeah so my idea is my sister\cb1 \
\cb3 she has a child and her fiance has two\cb1 \
\cb3 other children as well and they're\cb1 \
\cb3 together\cb1 \
\cb3 and so here's the thing man your sister\cb1 \
\cb3 has a child and your friend and her\cb1 \
\cb3 fiance you know what i hear chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 the black community is at the bottom you\cb1 \
\cb3 know why because all this damn chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 because we do [ __ ] out of order\cb1 \
\cb3 what what are we supposed to have\cb1 \
\cb3 supposed to get married before you have\cb1 \
\cb3 a kid he's supposed to stay with each\cb1 \
\cb3 other\cb1 \
\cb3 but no we we do this [ __ ] you're talking\cb1 \
\cb3 about and then you got\cb1 \
\cb3 got a 24 year old woman right here who\cb1 \
\cb3 has no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 trying to intercede for other people\cb1 \
\cb3 this is dysfunction\cb1 \
\cb3 so i'm going to leave this in this woman\cb1 \
\cb3 has no kids\cb1 \
\cb3 but she's involved in her brother's\cb1 \
\cb3 feelings and her sister's feelings\cb1 \
\cb3 and a woman she don't know feeling all\cb1 \
\cb3 of it because it's a bunch of [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 and we got to start calling it chaos\cb1 \
\cb3 this is not healthy this is not normal\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 appreciate you calling in young lady do\cb1 \
\cb3 yourself a favor\cb1 \
\cb3 before you make babies have a husband\cb1 \
\cb3 oh that's for sure because you know why\cb1 \
\cb3 why do you know that for sure\cb1 \
\cb3 because i see it i see the frustration\cb1 \
\cb3 with myself\cb1 \
\cb3 exactly thank you because you see what\cb1 \
\cb3 it's right and\cb1 \
\cb3 we need more people like you saying i\cb1 \
\cb3 see this [ __ ] and it's not a good\cb1 \
\cb3 thing\cb1 \
\cb3 i can love them but i don't want to\cb1 \
\cb3 reproduce i don't want to replicate that\cb1 \
\cb3 this is the same thing i was asking the\cb1 \
\cb3 previous lady would you want your son\cb1 \
\cb3 bringing home this [ __ ] and she couldn't\cb1 \
\cb3 be honest because\cb1 \
\cb3 she was too emotional she's too close to\cb1 \
\cb3 it\cb1 \
\cb3 thanks appreciate it all right\cb1 \
\cb3 don you want to or d lewis you want to\cb1 \
\cb3 try to come back in and calm yourself\cb1 \
\cb3 down\cb1 \
\cb3 because i'm not gonna change what i'm\cb1 \
\cb3 saying\cb1 \
\cb3 we have made it too simple to say oh\cb1 \
\cb3 well it's too bad\cb1 \
\cb3 it's not fair she made a mistake\cb1 \
\cb3 when do we start saying okay\cb1 \
\cb3 what are you going to do about it\cb1 \

\cb3 we attract what we are let me round it\cb1 \
\cb3 all back\cb1 \
\cb3 just like the woman i talked about in\cb1 \
\cb3 this video uh the woman i\cb1 \
\cb3 reached out to hey you can't make it up\cb1 \
\cb3 all that's in you ma'am and all you have\cb1 \
\cb3 to do is just\cb1 \
\cb3 ask a question\cb1 \
\cb3 seek therapy ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 seek therapy because i\cb1 \
\cb3 will not sit around and tell you well\cb1 \
\cb3 you know\cb1 \
\cb3 the world owes you understanding they\cb1 \
\cb3 don't care\cb1 \
\cb3 now just because you have a child does\cb1 \
\cb3 that mean it's a death sentence\cb1 \
\cb3 ah no but what it does\cb1 \
\cb3 mean is you need to sit down and realize\cb1 \
\cb3 that\cb1 \
\cb3 this ma this child right here\cb1 \
\cb3 is the product of a relationship with\cb1 \
\cb3 another man\cb1 \
\cb3 and whether i like it or not whether i\cb1 \
\cb3 understand or not whether i agree or not\cb1 \
\cb3 men the men that i want the men that i\cb1 \
\cb3 would want view this as a negative\cb1 \
\cb3 and everyone is going to come along and\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you well that's just not the right\cb1 \
\cb3 man for you\cb1 \
\cb3 and the man that's right for you will\cb1 \
\cb3 love your kids that is a bunch of\cb1 \
\cb3 [ __ ]\cb1 \
\cb3 i listen to everybody that tells women\cb1 \
\cb3 that and i say ladies\cb1 \
\cb3 you pay attention to guy like that at\cb1 \
\cb3 your own peril they're telling you what\cb1 \
\cb3 they want you to hear so they can\cb1 \
\cb3 so you can buy what they're selling\cb1 \
\cb3 men do not typically go out checking for\cb1 \
\cb3 women with children\cb1 \
\cb3 as the default setting we don't want it\cb1 \
\cb3 hey you want to go out this weekend\cb1 \
\cb3 where i need to find a sitter\cb1 \
\cb3 how many different times do we have to\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you this ladies having a child from\cb1 \
\cb3 another man\cb1 \
\cb3 is a negative\cb1 \
\cb3 and men are tired of explaining this\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over men are kind of explaining\cb1 \
\cb3 over and over and men are tired of\cb1 \
\cb3 hearing other men lie to you and act\cb1 \
\cb3 like well\cb1 \
\cb3 if you loved you he'll accept your\cb1 \
\cb3 children that is one of the worst\cb1 \
\cb3 lies this devilish [ __ ] is that what's\cb1 \
\cb3 one of the most devilish\cb1 \
\cb3 things that have ever been told to women\cb1 \
\cb3 that if if the man does not like it he\cb1 \
\cb3 ain't the right one for you\cb1 \
\cb3 that is some devilish [ __ ] in my opinion\cb1 \
\cb3 that takes all the responsibility off of\cb1 \
\cb3 the women and puts it on to the men as\cb1 \
\cb3 if the men are wrong for not wanting\cb1 \
\cb3 what's against nature\cb1 \
\cb3 and that's really bad in the black\cb1 \
\cb3 community try this and try this\cb1 \
\cb3 in korea try it in japan try it in china\cb1 \
\cb3 then they laugh at these concepts\cb1 \
\cb3 you don't want the problems marry before\cb1 \
\cb3 you carry\cb1 \
\cb3 so here we go\cb1 \
\cb3 uh i gotta grab me it's late uh it's\cb1 \
\cb3 been a good show\cb1 \
\cb3 uh shout out to you ma'am for helping me\cb1 \
\cb3 to make some more content\cb1 \
\cb3 with your uh silly self\cb1 \
\cb3 i really truly hope\cb1 \
\cb3 that um you ladies start getting more\cb1 \
\cb3 balanced information\cb1 \
\cb3 oh i'm going to make a response video to\cb1 \
\cb3 this uh i got something else coming\cb1 \
\cb3 tomorrow tomorrow night we have we have\cb1 \
\cb3 disagree\cb1 \
\cb3 tomorrow night is challenge tomorrow is\cb1 \
\cb3 challenge day challenge day\cb1 \
\cb3 do you have an issue challenge day you\cb1 \
\cb3 can bring it on in on challenge day we\cb1 \
\cb3 can talk about it\cb1 \
\cb3 um i should probably have somebody\cb1 \
\cb3 coming in i\cb1 \
\cb3 don't know how to pronounce your name\cb1 \
\cb3 nepal that's not nepal\cb1 \
\cb3 come by um let's also talk about this\cb1 \
\cb3 whole high value thing a lot of people\cb1 \
\cb3 getting their feelings about high value\cb1 \
\cb3 and like it or not high value men are\cb1 \
\cb3 valuable\cb1 \
\cb3 whether you like the way i defined it or\cb1 \
\cb3 not i at least put it down and it's not\cb1 \
\cb3 vague and nebulous what i did when i\cb1 \
\cb3 defined high value is i made it special\cb1 \
\cb3 and rare\cb1 \
\cb3 so you ladies understand how how\cb1 \
\cb3 how far apart it is from most men\cb1 \
\cb3 if every man was high value no man is\cb1 \
\cb3 high value\cb1 \
\cb3 but there are plenty of people out there\cb1 \
\cb3 will tell you that a man is high value\cb1 \
\cb3 in relation to a woman that is\cb1 \
\cb3 the video is coming but uh\cb1 \
\cb3 yeah ladies you got to decide who you're\cb1 \
\cb3 listening to\cb1 \
\cb3 i don't proclaim to know everything\cb1 \
\cb3 i just know what i know\cb1 \
\cb3 but if you want to have the best shot at\cb1 \
\cb3 having a healthy functioning\cb1 \
\cb3 relationship\cb1 \
\cb3 coming to it with no children is the\cb1 \
\cb3 best\cb1 \
\cb3 option\cb1 \
\cb3 if you do have a child you're going to\cb1 \
\cb3 have to let you're going to understand\cb1 \
\cb3 that men are going to have to decide\cb1 \
\cb3 whether or not they want to accept it or\cb1 \
\cb3 not\cb1 \
\cb3 and more men are going to reject it long\cb1 \
\cb3 term than accept it they'll\cb1 \
\cb3 say they're accepting it just to get in\cb1 \
\cb3 hit and leave\cb1 \
\cb3 but you ask your male friends ask men\cb1 \
\cb3 and your family\cb1 \
\cb3 would you choose to go out and marry\cb1 \
\cb3 a woman who has children from another\cb1 \
\cb3 man not\cb1 \
\cb3 date not deal with kick it ask men that\cb1 \
\cb3 you respect would you\cb1 \
\cb3 choose to go out and marry a woman who\cb1 \
\cb3 has children\cb1 \
\cb3 from another man and watch what they\cb1 \
\cb3 tell you\cb1 \
\cb3 all right till the next time\cb1 \
\cb3 y'all know how it is peace\cb1 \
\cb3 we are\cb1 \
\cb3 [Music]\cb1 \
\cb3 gone\cb1 \
